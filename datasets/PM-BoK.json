******************

The outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices,
principles, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and
applied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th
century, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect
of this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management.
This BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute
(PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book
could contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed and published A Guide to the Project Management Body of
Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).

PMI defines the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the
profession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices
that are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.

The body of knowledge (BOK) includes both published and unpublished materials. This body of knowledge is
constantly evolving. This PMBOK® Guide identifies a subset of the project management body of knowledge that is
generally recognized as good practice.
uu Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the
time, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.
uu Good practice means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques
to project management processes can enhance the chance of success over many projects in delivering the
expected business values and results.
The project manager works with the project team and other stakeholders to determine and use the appropriate
generally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs,
tools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as “tailoring” the application of the
knowledge described in this guide.
This PMBOK® Guide is different from a methodology. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques,
procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This PMBOK® Guide is a foundation upon which
organizations can build methodologies, policies, procedures, rules, tools and techniques, and life cycle phases
needed to practice project management.

THE STANDARD FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
This guide is based on The Standard for Project Management [1]. A standard is a document established by an authority,
custom, or general consent as a model or example. As an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, The
Standard for Project Management was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due
process, and balance. The Standard for Project Management is a foundational reference for PMI’s project management
professional development programs and the practice of project management. Because project management needs to
be tailored to fit the needs of the project, the standard and the guide are both based on descriptive practices, rather
than prescriptive practices. Therefore, the standard identifies the processes that are considered good practices on most
projects, most of the time. The standard also identifies the inputs and outputs that are usually associated with those
processes. The standard does not require that any particular process or practice be performed. The Standard for Project
Management is included as Part II of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).
The PMBOK® Guide provides more detail about key concepts, emerging trends, considerations for tailoring the project
management processes, and information on how tools and techniques are applied to projects. Project managers may
use one or more methodologies to implement the project management processes outlined in the standard.

The scope of this guide is limited to the discipline of project management, rather than the full spectrum of portfolios,
programs, and projects. Portfolios and programs will be addressed only to the degree they interact with projects. PMI
publishes two other standards that address the management of portfolios and programs:
uu The Standard for Portfolio Management [2], and
uu The Standard for Program Management [3].

1.1.2 COMMON VOCABULARY
A common vocabulary is an essential element of a professional discipline. The PMI Lexicon of Project Management
Terms [4] provides the foundational professional vocabulary that can be consistently used by organizations, portfolio,
program, and project managers and other project stakeholders. The Lexicon will continue to evolve over time. The
glossary to this guide includes the vocabulary in the Lexicon along with additional definitions. There may be other
industry-specific terms used in projects that are defined by that industry’s literature.

1.1.3 CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

PMI publishes the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [5] to instill confidence in the project management
profession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difficult situations where the
individual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values. The values that the global project management
community defined as most important were responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty. The Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct affirms these four values as its foundation.

The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes both aspirational standards and mandatory standards. The
aspirational standards describe the conduct that practitioners, who are also PMI members, certification holders, or
volunteers, strive to uphold. Although adherence to the aspirational standards is not easily measured, conduct in
accordance with these is an expectation for those who consider themselves to be professionals—it is not optional. The
mandatory standards establish firm requirements and, in some cases, limit or prohibit practitioner behavior. Practitioners
who are also PMI members, certification holders, or volunteers and who do not conduct themselves in accordance with
these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI’s Ethics Review Committee.

1.2 FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS
This section describes foundational elements necessary for working in and understanding the discipline of project
management.
1.2.1 PROJECTS
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
uu Unique product, service, or result. Projects are undertaken to fulfill objectives by producing deliverables.
An objective is defined as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained,
a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.
A deliverable is defined as any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is
required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible.
Fulfillment of project objectives may produce one or more of the following deliverables:
un A unique product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement or correction to an item,
or a new end item in itself (e.g., the correction of a defect in an end item);
un A unique service or a capability to perform a service (e.g., a business function that supports production
or distribution);
un A unique result, such as an outcome or document (e.g., a research project that develops knowledge that can
be used to determine whether a trend exists or a new process will benefit society); and
un A unique combination of one or more products, services, or results (e.g., a software application, its associated
documentation, and help desk services).

Repetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities. This repetition does not change
the fundamental and unique characteristics of the project work. For example, office buildings can be constructed
with the same or similar materials and by the same or different teams. However, each building project remains
unique in key characteristics (e.g., location, design, environment, situation, people involved).
Projects are undertaken at all organizational levels. A project can involve a single individual or a group. A project
can involve a single organizational unit or multiple organizational units from multiple organizations.


Examples of projects include but are not limited to:
un Developing a new pharmaceutical compound for market,
un Expanding a tour guide service,
un Merging two organizations,
un Improving a business process within an organization,
un Acquiring and installing a new computer hardware system for use in an organization,
un Exploring for oil in a region,
un Modifying a computer software program used in an organization,
un Conducting research to develop a new manufacturing process, and
un Constructing a building.

u Temporary endeavor. The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end.
Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration. The end of the project is reached when one
or more of the following is true:
un The project’s objectives have been achieved;
un The objectives will not or cannot be met;
un Funding is exhausted or no longer available for allocation to the project;
un The need for the project no longer exists (e.g., the customer no longer wants the project completed, a change
in strategy or priority ends the project, the organizational management provides direction to end the project);
un The human or physical resources are no longer available; or
un The project is terminated for legal cause or convenience.
Projects are temporary, but their deliverables may exist beyond the end of the project. Projects may produce
deliverables of a social, economic, material, or environmental nature. For example, a project to build a national
monument will create a deliverable expected to last for centuries.

u Projects drive change. Projects drive change in organizations. From a business perspective, a project is aimed
at moving an organization from one state to another state in order to achieve a specific objective (see Figure 1-1).
Before the project begins, the organization is commonly referred to as being in the current state. The desired
result of the change driven by the project is described as the future state.
For some projects, this may involve creating a transition state where multiple steps are made along a continuum
to achieve the future state. The successful completion of a project results in the organization moving to the
future state and achieving the specific objective. For more information on project management and change, see
Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [6].

u Projects enable business value creation. PMI defines business value as the net quantifiable benefit derived
from a business endeavor. The benefit may be tangible, intangible, or both. In business analysis, business value is
considered the return, in the form of elements such as time, money, goods, or intangibles in return for something
exchanged (see Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide, p. 185 [7]).
Business value in projects refers to the benefit that the results of a specific project provide to its stakeholders.
The benefit from projects may be tangible, intangible, or both.
Examples of tangible elements include:
un Monetary assets,
un Stockholder equity,
un Utility,
un Fixtures,
un Tools, and
un Market share.
Examples of intangible elements include:
un Goodwill,
un Brand recognition,
un Public benefit,
un Trademarks,
un Strategic alignment, and
un Reputation.

u Project Initiation Context. Organizational leaders initiate projects in response to factors acting upon their
organizations. There are four fundamental categories for these factors, which illustrate the context of a project
(see Figure 1-2):
un Meet regulatory, legal, or social requirements;
un Satisfy stakeholder requests or needs;
un Implement or change business or technological strategies; and
un Create, improve, or fix products, processes, or services.

These factors influence an organization’s ongoing operations and business strategies. Leaders respond to these
factors in order to keep the organization viable. Projects provide the means for organizations to successfully make the
changes necessary to deal with these factors. These factors ultimately should link to the strategic objectives of the
organization and the business value of each project.

1.2.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the
project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of the
project management processes identified for the project. Project management enables organizations to execute projects
effectively and efficiently.
Effective project management helps individuals, groups, and public and private organizations to:
uu Meet business objectives;
uu Satisfy stakeholder expectations;
uu Be more predictable;
uu Increase chances of success;
uu Deliver the right products at the right time;
uu Resolve problems and issues;
uu Respond to risks in a timely manner;
uu Optimize the use of organizational resources;
uu Identify, recover, or terminate failing projects;
uu Manage constraints (e.g., scope, quality, schedule, costs, resources);
uu Balance the influence of constraints on the project (e.g., increased scope may increase cost or schedule); and
uu Manage change in a better manner.
Poorly managed projects or the absence of project management may result in:
uu Missed deadlines,
uu Cost overruns,
uu Poor quality,
uu Rework,
uu Uncontrolled expansion of the project,
u Loss of reputation for the organization,
uu Unsatisfied stakeholders, and
uu Failure in achieving the objectives for which the project was undertaken.

Projects are a key way to create value and benefits in organizations. In today’s business environment, organizational
leaders need to be able to manage with tighter budgets, shorter timelines, scarcity of resources, and rapidly changing
technology. The business environment is dynamic with an accelerating rate of change. To remain competitive in the
world economy, companies are embracing project management to consistently deliver business value.

Effective and efficient project management should be considered a strategic competency within organizations. It enables
organizations to:
uu Tie project results to business goals,
uu Compete more effectively in their markets,
uu Sustain the organization, and
uu Respond to the impact of business environment changes on projects by appropriately adjusting project
management plans (see Section 4.2).

1.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF PROJECT, PROGRAM, PORTFOLIO, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
1.2.3.1 OVERVIEW

Using project management processes, tools, and techniques puts in place a sound foundation for organizations to
achieve their goals and objectives. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project
(outside of a portfolio or program), within a program, or within a portfolio. Project managers interact with portfolio and
program managers when a project is within a program or portfolio. For example, multiple projects may be needed to
accomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization. In those situations, projects may be grouped together into
a program. A program is defined as a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in
a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Programs are not large projects.
A very large project may be referred to as a megaproject. As a guideline, megaprojects cost US$1billion or more, affect
1 million or more people, and run for years.
Some organizations may employ the use of a project portfolio to effectively manage multiple programs and projects
that are underway at any given time. A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations
managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example of how portfolios, programs,
projects, and operations are related in a specific situation.
Program management and portfolio management differ from project management in their life cycles, activities,
objectives, focus, and benefits. However, portfolios, programs, projects, and operations often engage with the same
stakeholders and may need to use the same resources (see Figure 1-3), which may result in a conflict in the organization.
This type of a situation increases the need for coordination within the organization through the use of portfolio, program,
and project management to achieve a workable balance in the organization.

Figure 1-3 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships between the programs, projects, shared
resources, and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance
and management of the work that helps to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio
planning impact the components by means of prioritization based on risk, funding, and other considerations. The
portfolio view allows organizations to see how the strategic goals are reflected in the portfolio. This portfolio view
also enables the implementation and coordination of appropriate portfolio, program, and project governance. This
coordinated governance allows authorized allocation of human, financial, and physical resources based on expected
performance and benefits.

Looking at project, program, and portfolio management from an organizational perspective:
uu Program and project management focus on doing programs and projects the “right” way; and
uu Portfolio management focuses on doing the “right” programs and projects.
Table 1-2 gives a comparative overview of portfolios, programs, and projects.

Projects:

Definition: A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

Scope: Projects have defined objectives.Scope is progressively elaborated throughout the project life cycle.

Change: Project managers expect change and implement processes to keep change managed and controlled.

Planning: Project managers progressively elaborate high-level information into detailed plans throughout the project life cycle.

Management: Project managers manage the project team to meet the project objectives.

Monitoring: Project managers monitor and control the work of producing the products, services, or results that the project was undertaken to produce.

Success: Success is measured by product and project quality, timeliness, budget compliance, and degree of customer satisfaction.


Programs:

Definition: A program is a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

Scope: Programs have a scope that encompasses the scopes of its program components. Programs produce benefits to an organization by ensuring that the outputs and outcomes of program components are delivered in a coordinated and complementary manner.

Change: Programs are managed in a manner that accepts and adapts to change as necessary to optimize the delivery of benefits as the program’s components deliver outcomes and/or outputs.


Planning: Programs are managed using high-level plans that track the interdependencies and progress of program components. Program plans are also used to guide planning at the component level.

Management: Programs are managed by program managers who ensure that program benefits are delivered as expected, by coordinating the activities of a program’s components.

Monitoring: Program managers monitor the progress of program components to ensure the overall goals, schedules, budget, and benefits of the program will be met.

Success: A program’s success is measured by the program’s ability to deliver its intended benefits to an organization, and by the program’s efficiency and effectiveness in delivering those benefits.


Portfolios:

Definition: A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.

Scope: Portfolios have an organizational scope that changes with the strategic objectives of the organization.

Change: Portfolio managers continuously monitor changes in the broader internal and external environments.

Planning: Portfolio managers create and maintain necessary processes and communication relative to the aggregate portfolio.

Management: Portfolio managers may manage or coordinate portfolio management staff, or program and project staff that may have reporting responsibilities into the aggregate portfolio.

Monitoring: Portfolio managers monitor strategic changes and aggregate resource allocation, performance results, and risk of the portfolio.

Success: Success is measured in terms of the aggregate investment performance and benefit realization of the portfolio.


1.2.3.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
Program management is defined as the application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve the
program objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing program components individually.
A program component refers to projects and other programs within a program. Project management focuses on
interdependencies within a project to determine the optimal approach for managing the project. Program management
focuses on the interdependencies between projects and between projects and the program level to determine the
optimal approach for managing them. Actions related to these program and project-level interdependencies may include:
uu Aligning with the organizational or strategic direction that affects program and project goals and objectives;
uu Allocating the program scope into program components;
uu Managing interdependencies among the components of the program to best serve the program;
uu Managing program risks that may impact multiple projects in the program;
uu Resolving constraints and conflicts that affect multiple projects within the program;
uu Resolving issues between component projects and the program level;
uu Managing change requests within a shared governance framework;
uu Allocating budgets across multiple projects within the program; and
uu Assuring benefits realization from the program and component projects.
An example of a program is a new communications satellite system with projects for the design and construction of
the satellite and the ground stations, the launch of the satellite, and the integration of the system.
For more information on program management, see The Standard for Program Management [3].


1.2.3.3 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve
strategic objectives.
Portfolio management is defined as the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic
objectives. The programs or projects of the portfolio may not necessarily be interdependent or directly related.
The aim of portfolio management is to:
uu Guide organizational investment decisions.
uu Select the optimal mix of programs and projects to meet strategic objectives.
uu Provide decision-making transparency.
uu Prioritize team and physical resource allocation.
uu Increase the likelihood of realizing the desired return on investment.
uu Centralize the management of the aggregate risk profile of all components.
Portfolio management also confirms that the portfolio is consistent with and aligned with organizational strategies.
Maximizing the value of the portfolio requires careful examination of the components that comprise the portfolio.
Components are prioritized so that those contributing the most to the organization’s strategic objectives have the
required financial, team, and physical resources.
For example, an infrastructure organization that has the strategic objective of maximizing the return on its investments
may put together a portfolio that includes a mix of projects in oil and gas, power, water, roads, rail, and airports. From
this mix, the organization may choose to manage related projects as one portfolio. All of the power projects may be
grouped together as a power portfolio. Similarly, all of the water projects may be grouped together as a water portfolio.
However, when the organization has projects in designing and constructing a power plant and then operates the power
plant to generate energy, those related projects can be grouped in one program. Thus, the power program and similar
water program become integral components of the portfolio of the infrastructure organization.
For more information on portfolio management, see The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].


1.2.3.4 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
Operations management is an area that is outside the scope of formal project management as described in this guide.
Operations management is concerned with the ongoing production of goods and/or services. It ensures that business
operations continue efficiently by using the optimal resources needed to meet customer demands. It is concerned with
managing processes that transform inputs (e.g., materials, components, energy, and labor) into outputs (e.g., products,
goods, and/or services).


1.2.3.5 OPERATIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Changes in business or organizational operations may be the focus of a project—especially when there are substantial
changes to business operations as a result of a new product or service delivery. Ongoing operations are outside of the
scope of a project; however, there are intersecting points where the two areas cross.
Projects can intersect with operations at various points during the product life cycle, such as;
uu When developing a new product, upgrading a product, or expanding outputs;
uu While improving operations or the product development process;
uu At the end of the product life cycle; and
uu At each closeout phase.
At each point, deliverables and knowledge are transferred between the project and operations for implementation of
the delivered work. This implementation occurs through a transfer of project resources or knowledge to operations or
through a transfer of operational resources to the project.


1.2.3.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT (OPM) AND STRATEGIES
Portfolios, programs, and projects are aligned with or driven by organizational strategies and differ in the way each
contributes to the achievement of strategic goals:
uu Portfolio management aligns portfolios with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects,
prioritizing the work, and providing the needed resources.
uu Program management harmonizes its program components and controls interdependencies in order to realize
specified benefits.
uu Project management enables the achievement of organizational goals and objectives. 


Within portfolios or programs, projects are a means of achieving organizational goals and objectives. This is often
accomplished in the context of a strategic plan that is the primary factor guiding investments in projects. Alignment
with the organization’s strategic business goals can be achieved through the systematic management of portfolios,
programs, and projects through the application of organizational project management (OPM). OPM is defined as a
framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to
achieve strategic objectives.
The purpose of OPM is to ensure that the organization undertakes the right projects and allocates critical resources
appropriately. OPM also helps to ensure that all levels in the organization understand the strategic vision, the initiatives
that support the vision, the objectives, and the deliverables. Figure 1-4 shows the organizational environment where
strategy, portfolio, programs, projects, and operations interact.
For more information on OPM, refer to Implementing Organizational Project Management: A Practice Guide [8].


1.2.4 COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDE
Projects comprise several key components that, when effectively managed, result in their successful completion.
This guide identifies and explains these components. The various components interrelate to one another during the
management of a project.
The key components are described briefly in Table 1-3. These components are more fully explained in the sections
that follow the table.

Project lify cicle: The series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion.

Project phase: A collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of
one or more deliverables

Phase gate: A review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next
phase, to continue with modification, or to end a program or project.

Project management processes: A systematic series of activities directed toward causing an end result where one or
more inputs will be acted upon to create one or more outputs.

Project Management Process Group: A logical grouping of project management inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.
The Project Management Process Groups include Initiating, Planning, Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Project Management Process Groups are not
project phases.

Project Management Project Area: An identified area of project management defined by its knowledge requirements and
described in terms of its component processes, practices, inputs, outputs, tools, and
techniques.


Project Life Cycle:
* Starting the Project
* Organizing and Preparing
* Carrying Out the Work
* Ending the Project

KEY:
* Phase Gate
* Project Phase
* Potential Use
* Timeline


1.2.4.1 PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES
A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. It provides
the basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework applies regardless of the specific project work
involved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle
shown in Figure 1-5.
Project life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases
that are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle.
Development life cycles can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or a hybrid model:
uu In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any
changes to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles.
uu In an iterative life cycle, the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but time
and cost estimates are routinely modified as the project team’s understanding of the product increases.
Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the
functionality of the product.
uu In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add
functionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufficient capability
to be considered complete only after the final iteration.
uu Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is defined and approved before the start
of an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. See Appendix X3.
uu A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project that
are well known or have fixed requirements follow a predictive development life cycle, and those elements that
are still evolving follow an adaptive development life cycle.
It is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle
needs to be flexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project. Life cycle flexibility may be
accomplished by:
uu Identifying the process or processes needed to be performed in each phase,
uu Performing the process or processes identified in the appropriate phase,
uu Adjusting the various attributes of a phase (e.g., name, duration, exit criteria, and entrance criteria).
Project life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which may be produced by a project. A product life cycle
is the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and
to retirement.

1.2.4.2 PROJECT PHASE
A project phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more
deliverables. The phases in a life cycle can be described by a variety of attributes. Attributes may be measurable and
unique to a specific phase. Attributes may include but are not limited to:
uu Name (e.g., Phase A, Phase B, Phase 1, Phase 2, proposal phase),
uu Number (e.g., three phases in the project, five phases in the project),
uu Duration (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter),
uu Resource requirements (e.g., people, buildings, equipment),
uu Entrance criteria for a project to move into that phase (e.g., specified approvals documented, specified documents
completed), and
uu Exit criteria for a project to complete a phase (e.g., documented approvals, completed documents, completed
deliverables).
Projects may be separated into distinct phases or subcomponents. These phases or subcomponents are generally
given names that indicate the type of work done in that phase. Examples of phase names include but are not limited to:
uu Concept development,
uu Feasibility study,
uu Customer requirements,
uu Solution development,
uu Design,
uu Prototype,
uu Build,
uu Test,
uu Transition,
uu Commissioning,
uu Milestone review, and
uu Lessons learned.


The project phases may be established based on various factors including, but not limited to:
uu Management needs;
uu Nature of the project;
uu Unique characteristics of the organization, industry, or technology;
uu Project elements including, but not limited to, technology, engineering, business, process, or legal; and
uu Decision points (e.g., funding, project go/no-go, and milestone review).

Using multiple phases may provide better insight to managing the project. It also provides an opportunity to assess
the project performance and take necessary corrective or preventive actions in subsequent phases. A key component
used with project phases is the phase review (see Section 1.2.4.3).


1.2.4.3 PHASE GATE
A phase gate, is held at the end of a phase. The project’s performance and progress are compared to project and
business documents including but not limited to:
uu Project business case (see Section 1.2.6.1),
uu Project charter (see Section 4.1),
uu Project management plan (see Section 4.2), and
uu Benefits management plan (see Section 1.2.6.2).
A decision (e.g., go/no-go decision) is made as a result of this comparison to:
uu Continue to the next phase,
uu Continue to the next phase with modification,
uu End the project,
uu Remain in the phase, or
uu Repeat the phase or elements of it.
Depending on the organization, industry, or type of work, phase gates may be referred to by other terms such as,
phase review, stage gate, kill point, and phase entrance or phase exit. Organizations may use these reviews to examine
other pertinent items which are beyond the scope of this guide, such as product-related documents or models.


1.2.4.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
The project life cycle is managed by executing a series of project management activities known as project
management processes. Every project management process produces one or more outputs from one or more inputs by
using appropriate project management tools and techniques. The output can be a deliverable or an outcome. Outcomes
are an end result of a process. Project management processes apply globally across industries.
Project management processes are logically linked by the outputs they produce. Processes may contain overlapping
activities that occur throughout the project. The output of one process generally results in either:
uu An input to another process, or
uu A deliverable of the project or project phase.
Figure 1-6 shows an example of how inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs relate to each other within a process,
and with other processes. 


The number of process iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.
Processes generally fall into one of three categories:
uu Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. The processes Develop Project Charter and Close
Project or Phase are examples.
uu Processes that are performed periodically as needed. The process Acquire Resources is performed as
resources are needed. The process Conduct Procurements is performed prior to needing the procured item.
uu Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. The process Define Activities may
occur throughout the project life cycle, especially if the project uses rolling wave planning or an adaptive
development approach. Many of the monitoring and control processes are ongoing from the start of the
project, until it is closed out.
Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of logically grouped project
management processes. While there are different ways of grouping processes, the PMBOK® Guide groups processes
into five categories called Process Groups.


1.2.4.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS GROUPS
A Project Management Process Group is a logical grouping of project management processes to achieve specific
project objectives. Process Groups are independent of project phases. Project management processes are grouped into
the following five Project Management Process Groups:
uu Initiating Process Group. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing
project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
uu Planning Process Group. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives,
and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
uu Executing Process Group. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management
plan to satisfy the project requirements.
uu Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the
progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and
initiate the corresponding changes.
uu Closing Process Group. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase, or contract.
Process flow diagrams are used throughout this guide. The project management processes are linked by
specific inputs and outputs where the result or outcome of one process may become the input to another process
that is not necessarily in the same Process Group. Note that Process Groups are not the same as project phases
(see Section 1.2.4.2).


1.2.4.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE AREAS
In addition to Process Groups, processes are also categorized by Knowledge Areas. A Knowledge Area is an identified
area of project management defined by its knowledge requirements and described in terms of its component processes,
practices, inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques.
Although the Knowledge Areas are interrelated, they are defined separately from the project management perspective.
The ten Knowledge Areas identified in this guide are used in most projects most of the time. The ten Knowledge Areas
described in this guide are:
uu Project Integration Management. Includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify,
and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management
Process Groups.
uu Project Scope Management. Includes the processes required to ensure the project includes all the work
required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully

u Project Schedule Management. Includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.
uu Project Cost Management. Includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing,
funding, managing, and controlling costs so the project can be completed within the approved budget.
uu Project Quality Management. Includes the processes for incorporating the organization’s quality policy
regarding planning, managing, and controlling project and product quality requirements, in order to meet
stakeholders’ expectations.
uu Project Resource Management. Includes the processes to identify, acquire, and manage the resources needed
for the successful completion of the project.
uu Project Communications Management. Includes the processes required to ensure timely and appropriate
planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and ultimate
disposition of project information.
uu Project Risk Management. Includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification,
analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project.
uu Project Procurement Management. Includes the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products,
services, or results needed from outside the project team.
uu Project Stakeholder Management. Includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or
organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder expectations and their
impact on the project, and to develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders
in project decisions and execution.
The needs of a specific project may require one or more additional Knowledge Areas, for example, construction may
require financial management or safety and health management. Table 1-4 maps the Project Management Process
Groups and Knowledge Areas. Sections 4 through 13 provide more detail about each Knowledge Area. This table is an
overview of the basic processes described in Sections 4 through 13.


1.2.4.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATA AND INFORMATION
Throughout the life cycle of a project, a significant amount of data is collected, analyzed, and transformed. Project
data are collected as a result of various processes and are shared within the project team. The collected data
are analyzed in context, aggregated, and transformed to become project information during various processes.
Information is communicated verbally or stored and distributed in various formats as reports. See Section 4.3 for
more detail on this topic.
Project data are regularly collected and analyzed throughout the project life cycle. The following definitions identify
key terminology regarding project data and information:
uu Work performance data. The raw observations and measurements identified during activities performed to
carry out the project work. Examples include reported percent of work physically completed, quality and technical
performance measures, start and finish dates of schedule activities, number of change requests, number of
defects, actual costs, actual durations, etc. Project data are usually recorded in a Project Management Information
System (PMIS) (see Section 4.3.2.2) and in project documents.
uu Work performance information. The performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed
in context and integrated based on relationships across areas. Examples of performance information are status
of deliverables, implementation status for change requests, and forecast estimates to complete.
uu Work performance reports. The physical or electronic representation of work performance information
compiled in project documents, which is intended to generate decisions or raise issues, actions, or
awareness. Examples include status reports, memos, justifications, information notes, electronic dashboards,
recommendations, and updates.
Figure 1-7 shows the flow of project information across the various processes used in managing the project.


1.2.5 TAILORING
Usually, project managers apply a project management methodology to their work. A methodology is a system of
practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This definition makes it clear that
this guide itself is not a methodology.
This guide and The Standard for Project Management [1] are recommended references for tailoring, because these
standard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as
good practice. “Good practice” does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all
projects. Specific methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide.
Project management methodologies may be:
uu Developed by experts within the organization,
uu Purchased from vendors,
uu Obtained from professional associations, or
uu Acquired from government agencies.
The appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be
selected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project. The project
manager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, organizational management, or some combination thereof, in the
tailoring. In some cases, the organization may require specific project management methodologies be used.
Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identified
in the PMBOK® Guide is required on every project. Tailoring should address the competing constraints of scope,
schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the
project manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational
culture, stakeholder needs, and other variables.
In tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of governance that may
be required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the culture of the organization. In addition,
consideration of whether the customer of the project is internal or external to the organization may affect project
management tailoring decisions.
Sound project management methodologies take into account the unique nature of projects and allow tailoring,
to some extent, by the project manager. However, the tailoring that is included in the methodology may still require
additional tailoring for a given project.


1.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
The project manager needs to ensure that the project management approach captures the intent of business
documents. These documents are defined in Table 1-5. These two documents are interdependent and iteratively
developed and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project.

The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the project business case
document. The project manager is responsible for providing recommendations and oversight to keep the project
business case, project management plan, project charter, and project benefits management plan success measures in
alignment with one another and with the goals and objectives of the organization.
Project managers should appropriately tailor the noted project management documents for their projects. In some
organizations, the business case and benefits management plan are maintained at the program level. Project managers
should work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the project management documents are aligned with
the program documents. Figure 1-8 illustrates the interrelationship of these critical project management business
documents and the needs assessment. Figure 1-8 shows an approximation of the life cycle of these various documents
against the project life cycle.


1.2.6.1 PROJECT BUSINESS CASE
The project business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits
of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further project
management activities. The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the
project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document
that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result
in a go/no-go decision for the project.
A needs assessment often precedes the business case. The needs assessment involves understanding business
goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. The results of the needs
assessment may be summarized in the business case document.

The process of defining the business need, analyzing the situation, making recommendations, and defining evaluation
criteria is applicable to any organization’s projects. A business case may include but is not limited to documenting
the following:
uu Business needs:
un Determination of what is prompting the need for action;
un Situational statement documenting the business problem or opportunity to be addressed including the value
to be delivered to the organization;
un Identification of stakeholders affected; and
un Identification of the scope.
uu Analysis of the situation:
un Identification of organizational strategies, goals, and objectives;
un Identification of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an opportunity;
un Gap analysis of capabilities needed for the project versus existing capabilities of the organization;
un Identification of known risks;
un Identification of critical success factors;
un Identification of decision criteria by which the various courses of action may be assessed;
Examples of criteria categories used for analysis of a situation are:
um Required. This is a criterion that is “required” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
um Desired. This is a criterion that is “desired” to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
um Optional. This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulfillment of this criterion may become a differentiator
between alternative courses of action.
un Identification of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options
are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as
business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:
um Do nothing. This is also referred to as the “business as usual” option. Selection of this option results in the
project not being authorized.
um Do the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. The minimum may be established
by identifying the set of documented criteria that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity.
um Do more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. This option meets the
minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of
these options documented in the business case.

u Recommendation:
un A statement of the recommended option to pursue in the project;
un Items to include in the statement may include but are not limited to:
um Analysis results for the potential option;
um Constraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies for the potential options;
and
um Success measures (see Section 1.2.6.4).
un An implementation approach that may include but is not limited to:
um Milestones,
um Dependencies, and
um Roles and responsibilities.
uu Evaluation:
un Statement describing the plan for measuring benefits the project will deliver. This should include any ongoing
operational aspects of the recommended option beyond initial implementation.
The business case document provides the basis to measure success and progress throughout the project life cycle
by comparing the results with the objectives and the identified success criteria. See Business Analysis for Practitioners:
A Practice Guide [7].


1.2.6.2 PROJECT BENEFITS MANAGEMENT PLAN
The project benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the benefits of the project
will be delivered, and describes the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those benefits. A project benefit
is defined as an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services, or results that provide value to the sponsoring
organization as well as to the project’s intended beneficiaries. Development of the benefits management plan begins
early in the project life cycle with the definition of the target benefits to be realized. The benefits management plan
describes key elements of the benefits and may include but is not limited to documenting the following:
uu Target benefits (e.g., the expected tangible and intangible value to be gained by the implementation of the
project; financial value is expressed as net present value);
uu Strategic alignment (e.g., how well the project benefits align to the business strategies of the organization);
uu Timeframe for realizing benefits (e.g., benefits by phase, short-term, long-term, and ongoing);
uu Benefits owner (e.g., the accountable person to monitor, record, and report realized benefits throughout the
timeframe established in the plan);
uu Metrics (e.g., the measures to be used to show benefits realized, direct measures, and indirect measures);
uu Assumptions (e.g., factors expected to be in place or to be in evidence); and
uu Risks (e.g., risks for realization of benefits).
Developing the benefits management plan makes use of the data and information documented in the business case
and needs assessment. For example, the cost-benefit analyses recorded in the documents illustrate the estimate of
costs compared to the value of the benefits realized by the project. The benefits management plan and the project
management plan include a description of how the business value resulting from the project becomes part of the
organization’s ongoing operations, including the metrics to be used. The metrics provide verification of the business
value and validation of the project’s success.
Development and maintenance of the project benefits management plan is an iterative activity. This document
complements the business case, project charter, and project management plan. The project manager works with the
sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management plan, and the benefits management plan remain in
alignment throughout the life cycle of the project. See Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7], The
Standard for Program Management [3], and The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].


1.2.6.3 PROJECT CHARTER AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
The project charter is defined as a document issued by the project sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
The project management plan is defined as the document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored,
and controlled.
See Section 4 on Project Integration Management for more information on the project charter and the project
management plan.


1.2.6.4 PROJECT SUCCESS MEASURES
One of the most common challenges in project management is determining whether or not a project is successful.
Traditionally, the project management metrics of time, cost, scope, and quality have been the most important factors
in defining the success of a project. More recently, practitioners and scholars have determined that project success
should also be measured with consideration toward achievement of the project objectives.
Project stakeholders may have different ideas as to what the successful completion of a project will look like and
which factors are the most important. It is critical to clearly document the project objectives and to select objectives that
are measurable. Three questions that the key stakeholders and the project manager should answer are:
uu What does success look like for this project?
uu How will success be measured?
uu What factors may impact success?
The answer to these questions should be documented and agreed upon by the key stakeholders and the
project manager.

Project success may include additional criteria linked to the organizational strategy and to the delivery of business
results. These project objectives may include but are not limited to:
uu Completing the project benefits management plan;
uu Meeting the agreed-upon financial measures documented in the business case. These financial measures may
include but are not limited to:
un Net present value (NPV),
un Return on investment (ROI),
un Internal rate of return (IRR),
un Payback period (PBP), and
un Benefit-cost ratio (BCR).

u Meeting business case nonfinancial objectives;
uu Completing movement of an organization from its current state to the desired future state;
uu Fulfilling contract terms and conditions;
uu Meeting organizational strategy, goals, and objectives;
uu Achieving stakeholder satisfaction;
uu Acceptable customer/end-user adoption;
uu Integration of deliverables into the organization’s operating environment;
uu Achieving agreed-upon quality of delivery;
uu Meeting governance criteria; and
uu Achieving other agreed-upon success measures or criteria (e.g., process throughput).
The project team needs to be able to assess the project situation, balance the demands, and maintain proactive
communication with stakeholders in order to deliver a successful project.
When the business alignment for a project is constant, the chance for project success greatly increases because the
project remains aligned with the strategic direction of the organization.
It is possible for a project to be successful from a scope/schedule/budget viewpoint, and to be unsuccessful from a
business viewpoint. This can occur when there is a change in the business needs or the market environment before the
project is completed.


THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PROJECTS OPERATE
2.1 OVERVIEW
Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an influence on them. These influences can have a favorable
or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of influences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and
organizational process assets (OPAs).
EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. EEFs may have an
impact at the organizational, portfolio, program, or project level. See Section 2.2 for additional information on EEFs.
OPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a program, another
project, or a combination of these. Figure 2-1 shows the breakdown of project influences into EEFs and OPAs. See
Section 2.3 for additional information on OPAs.

In addition to EEFs and OPAs, organizational systems play a significant role in the life cycle of the project. System
factors that impact the power, influence, interests, competencies, and political capabilities of the people to act within the
organizational system are discussed further in the section on organizational systems.


2.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) refer to conditions, not under the control of the project team, that influence,
constrain, or direct the project. These conditions can be internal and/or external to the organization. EEFs are
considered as inputs to many project management processes, specifically for most planning processes. These factors
may enhance or constrain project management options. In addition, these factors may have a positive or negative
influence on the outcome.
EEFs vary widely in type or nature. These factors need to be considered if the project is to be effective. EEFs include
but are not limited to the factors described in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.
2.2.1 EEFS INTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
The following EEFs are internal to the organization:
uu Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural
norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, organizational style, ethics, and code of conduct.
uu Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations, virtual teams, shared
systems, and cloud computing.
uu Infrastructure. Examples include existing facilities, equipment, organizational telecommunications channels,
information technology hardware, availability, and capacity.
uu Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software tools, configuration management
systems, web interfaces to other online automated systems, and work authorization systems.
uu Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, approved providers and
subcontractors, and collaboration agreements.
uu Employee capability. Examples include existing human resources expertise, skills, competencies, and
specialized knowledge.


2.2.2 EEFS EXTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
The following EEFs are external to the organization.
uu Marketplace conditions. Examples include competitors, market share brand recognition, and trademarks.
uu Social and cultural influences and issues. Examples include political climate, codes of conduct, ethics,
and perceptions.
uu Legal restrictions. Examples include country or local laws and regulations related to security, data protection,
business conduct, employment, and procurement.
uu Commercial databases. Examples include benchmarking results, standardized cost estimating data, industry
risk study information, and risk databases.
uu Academic research. Examples include industry studies, publications, and benchmarking results.
uu Government or industry standards. Examples include regulatory agency regulations and standards related to
products, production, environment, quality, and workmanship.
uu Financial considerations. Examples include currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, tariffs, and
geographic location.
uu Physical environmental elements. Examples include working conditions, weather, and constraints.


2.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases specific to
and used by the performing organization. These assets influence the management of the project.
OPAs include any artifact, practice, or knowledge from any or all of the performing organizations involved in the
project that can be used to execute or govern the project. The OPAs also include the organization’s lessons learned from
previous projects and historical information. OPAs may include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data.
OPAs are inputs to many project management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team
members may be able to update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. They
may be grouped into two categories:
uu Processes, policies, and procedures; and
uu Organizational knowledge bases.

Generally, the assets in the first category are not updated as part of the project work. Processes, policies, and
procedures are usually established by the project management office (PMO) or another function outside of the project.
These can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated with updating processes,
policies, or procedures. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor templates, life cycles, and checklists for the
project. In these instances, the project management team should tailor those assets to meet the needs of the project.
The assets in the second category are updated throughout the project with project information. For example,
information on financial performance, lessons learned, performance metrics and issues, and defects are continually
updated throughout the project.


2.3.1 PROCESSES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES
The organization’s processes and procedures for conducting project work include but are not limited to:
uu Initiating and Planning:
un Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the
specific needs of the project;
un Specific organizational standards such as policies (e.g., human resources policies, health and safety policies,
security and confidentiality policies, quality policies, procurement policies, and environmental policies);
un Product and project life cycles, and methods and procedures (e.g., project management methods,
estimation metrics, process audits, improvement targets, checklists, and standardized process definitions
for use in the organization);
un Templates (e.g., project management plans, project documents, project registers, report formats, contract
templates, risk categories, risk statement templates, probability and impact definitions, probability and
impact matrices, and stakeholder register templates); and
un Preapproved supplier lists and various types of contractual agreements (e.g., fixed-price, cost-reimbursable,
and time and material contracts).
uu Executing, Monitoring, and Controlling:
un Change control procedures, including the steps by which performing organization standards, policies, plans, and
procedures or any project documents will be modified, and how any changes will be approved and validated;
un Traceability matrices;
un Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews,
accounting codes, and standard contract provisions);

un Issue and defect management procedures (e.g., defining issue and defect controls, identifying and resolving
issues and defects, and tracking action items);
un Resource availability control and assignment management;
un Organizational communication requirements (e.g., specific communication technology available, authorized
communication media, record retention policies, videoconferencing, collaborative tools, and security
requirements);
un Procedures for prioritizing, approving, and issuing work authorizations;
un Templates (e.g., risk register, issue log, and change log);
un Standardized guidelines, work instructions, proposal evaluation criteria, and performance measurement
criteria; and
un Product, service, or result verification and validation procedures.
uu Closing. Project closure guidelines or requirements (e.g., final project audits, project evaluations, deliverable
acceptance, contract closure, resource reassignment, and knowledge transfer to production and/or operations).


2.3.2 ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES
The organizational knowledge repositories for storing and retrieving information include but are not limited to:
uu Configuration management knowledge repositories containing the versions of software and hardware components and
baselines of all performing organization standards, policies, procedures, and any project documents;
uu Financial data repositories containing information such as labor hours, incurred costs, budgets, and any project
cost overruns;
uu Historical information and lessons learned knowledge repositories (e.g., project records and documents, all project
closure information and documentation, information regarding both the results of previous project selection decisions
and previous project performance information, and information from risk management activities);
uu Issue and defect management data repositories containing issue and defect status, control information, issue and
defect resolution, and action item results;
uu Data repositories for metrics used to collect and make available measurement data on processes and
products; and
uu Project files from previous projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule, and performance measurement baselines, project
calendars, project schedule network diagrams, risk registers, risk reports, and stakeholder registers).


2.4 ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS
2.4.1 OVERVIEW
Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework.
To operate effectively and efficiently, the project manager needs to understand where responsibility, accountability, and
authority reside within the organization. This understanding will help the project manager effectively use his or her
power, influence, competence, leadership, and political capabilities to successfully complete the project.
The interaction of multiple factors within an individual organization creates a unique system that impacts the project
operating in that system. The resulting organizational system determines the power, influence, interests, competence,
and political capabilities of the people who are able to act within the system. The system factors include but are not
limited to:
uu Management elements,
uu Governance frameworks, and
uu Organizational structure types.
The complete information and explanation of the organizational system factors and how the combination of
these factors impacts a project are beyond the scope of this guide. There are disciplines with associated literature,
methodologies, and practices that address these factors in more depth than is possible within this guide. This section
provides an overview of these factors and their interrelationship.
This overview begins by discussing systems in general. A system is a collection of various components that together
can produce results not obtainable by the individual components alone. A component is an identifiable element within
the project or organization that provides a particular function or group of related functions. The interaction of the various
system components creates the organizational culture and capabilities. There are several principles regarding systems:
uu Systems are dynamic,
uu Systems can be optimized,
uu System components can be optimized,
uu Systems and their components cannot be optimized at the same time, and
uu Systems are nonlinear in responsiveness (a change in the input does not produce a predictable change in
the output).

Multiple changes may occur within the system and between the system and its environment. When these changes
take place, adaptive behavior occurs within the components that in turn add to the system’s dynamics. The system’s
dynamics are defined by the interaction between the components based on the relationships and dependencies that
exist between the components.
Systems are typically the responsibility of an organization’s management. The organization’s management examines
the optimization trade-offs between the components and the system in order to take the appropriate action to achieve
the best outcomes for the organization. The results of this examination will impact the project under consideration.
Therefore, it is important that the project manager take these results into account when determining how to fulfill the
project’s objectives. In addition, the project manager should take into account the organization’s governance framework.

2.4.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS
Recent PMI research reveals that governance refers to organizational or structural arrangements at all levels of
an organization designed to determine and influence the behavior of the organization’s members [9]. This research
suggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and:
uu Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and
uu Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback.
2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes but is not
limited to:
uu Rules,
uu Policies,
uu Procedures,
uu Norms,
uu Relationships,
uu Systems, and
uu Processes.
This framework influences how:
uu Objectives of the organization are set and achieved,
uu Risk is monitored and assessed, and
uu Performance is optimized.

2.4.2.2 GOVERNANCE OF PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS
The Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10] describes a common governance
framework aligning organizational project management (OPM) and portfolio, program, and project management.
The practice guide describes four governance domains of alignment, risk, performance, and communications.
Each domain has the following functions: oversight, control, integration, and decision making. Each function has
governance supporting processes and activities for stand-alone projects, or projects operating within the portfolio or
program environments.
Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in
order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is
no one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the
organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective.
For more information regarding project governance, including its implementation, see Governance of Portfolios,
Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide


2.4.3 MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS
Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in
the organization. The general management elements are allocated within the organization according to its governance
framework and the organizational structure type selected.
The key functions or principles of management include but are not limited to:
uu Division of work using specialized skills and availability to perform work;
uu Authority given to perform work;
uu Responsibility to perform work appropriately assigned based on such attributes as skill and experience;
uu Discipline of action (e.g., respect for authority, people, and rules);
uu Unity of command (e.g., only one person gives orders for any action or activity to an individual);
uu Unity of direction (e.g., one plan and one head for a group of activities with the same objective);
uu General goals of the organization take precedence over individual goals;
uu Paid fairly for work performed;


u Optimal use of resources;
uu Clear communication channels;
uu Right materials to the right person for the right job at the right time;
uu Fair and equal treatment of people in the workplace;
uu Clear security of work positions;
uu Safety of people in the workplace;
uu Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and
uu Optimal morale.
Performance of these management elements are assigned to selected individuals within the organization. These
individuals may perform the noted functions within various organizational structures. For example, in a hierarchical
structure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line
management level through to the executive management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned
to the hierarchical level indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.


2.4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES
Determination of the appropriate organizational structure type is a result of the study of tradeoffs between two
key variables. The variables are the organizational structure types available for use and how to optimize them for a
given organization. There is not a one-size-fits-all structure for any given organization. The final structure for a given
organization is unique due to the numerous variables to be considered. Sections 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2 give examples of
some of the factors to be included when considering the two variables given. Section 2.4.4.3 discusses one organizational
structure that is prevalent in project management.


2.4.4.1 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES
Organizational structures take many forms or types. Table 2-1 compares several types of organizational structures
and their influence on projects.

2.4.4.2 FACTORS IN ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE SELECTION
Each organization considers numerous factors for inclusion in its organizational structure. Each factor may carry
a different level of importance in the final analysis. The combination of the factor, its value, and relative importance
provides the organization’s decision makers with the right information for inclusion in the analysis.
Factors to consider in selecting an organizational structure include but are not limited to:
uu Degree of alignment with organizational objectives,
uu Specialization capabilities,
uu Span of control, efficiency, and effectiveness,
uu Clear path for escalation of decisions,
uu Clear line and scope of authority,
uu Delegation capabilities,
uu Accountability assignment,
uu Responsibility assignment,
uu Adaptability of design,
uu Simplicity of design,
uu Efficiency of performance,
uu Cost considerations,
uu Physical locations (e.g., colocated, regional, and virtual), and
uu Clear communication (e.g., policies, status of work, and organization’s vision).


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Table 2-1. Influences of Organizational Structures on Projects

2.4.4.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE
A project management office (PMO) is an organizational structure that standardizes the project-related governance
processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. The responsibilities of a PMO
can range from providing project management support functions to the direct management of one or more projects.
There are several types of PMOs in organizations. Each type varies in the degree of control and influence it has on
projects within the organization, such as:
uu Supportive. Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices,
training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. This type of PMO serves as a project
repository. The degree of control provided by the PMO is low.
uu Controlling. Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. The degree of
control provided by the PMO is moderate. Compliance may involve:
un Adoption of project management frameworks or methodologies;
un Use of specific templates, forms, and tools; and
un Conformance to governance frameworks.
uu Directive. Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. Project managers are
assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by the PMO is high.
The project management office may have organization-wide responsibility. It may play a role in supporting strategic
alignment and delivering organizational value. The PMO integrates data and information from organizational strategic
projects and evaluates how higher-level strategic objectives are being fulfilled. The PMO is the natural liaison between the
organization’s portfolios, programs, projects, and the organizational measurement systems (e.g., balanced scorecard).
The projects supported or administered by the PMO may not be related other than by being managed together. The
specific form, function, and structure of a PMO are dependent upon the needs of the organization that it supports.


A PMO may have the authority to act as an integral stakeholder and a key decision maker throughout the life of each
project in order to keep it aligned with the business objectives. The PMO may:
uu Make recommendations,
uu Lead knowledge transfer,
uu Terminate projects, and
uu Take other actions, as required.
A primary function of a PMO is to support project managers in a variety of ways, which may include but are not
limited to:
uu Managing shared resources across all projects administered by the PMO;
uu Identifying and developing project management methodology, best practices, and standards;
uu Coaching, mentoring, training, and oversight;
uu Monitoring compliance with project management standards, policies, procedures, and templates by means of
project audits;
uu Developing and managing project policies, procedures, templates, and other shared documentation (organizational
process assets); and
uu Coordinating communication across projects.


3 THE ROLE OF THE PROJECT MANAGER
3.1 OVERVIEW

The project manager plays a critical role in the leadership of a project team in order to achieve the project’s
objectives. This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers become involved in a project from
its initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, a project manager may be involved in evaluation and
analysis activities prior to project initiation. These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit
leaders on ideas for advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer needs.
In some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage or assist in business analysis,
business case development, and aspects of portfolio management for a project. A project manager may also be involved
in follow-on activities related to realizing business benefits from the project. The role of a project manager may vary
from organization to organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to fit the organization in the same
way that the project management processes are tailored to fit the project.
A simple analogy may help in understanding the roles of a project manager for a large project by comparing them to
the roles of a conductor for a large orchestra:
uu Membership and roles. A large project and an orchestra each comprise many members, each playing a
different role. A large orchestra may have more than 100 musicians who are led by a conductor. These musicians
may play 25 different kinds of instruments placed into major sections, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and
percussion. Similarly, a large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. Team
members may fulfill many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and facilities management. Like the
major sections of the orchestra, they represent multiple business units or groups within an organization. The
musicians and the project members make up each leader’s team.
uu Responsibility for team. The project manager and conductor are both responsible for what their teams
produce—the project outcome or the orchestra concert, respectively. The two leaders need to take a holistic
view of their team’s products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. The two leaders begin by reviewing
the vision, mission, and objectives of their respective organizations to ensure alignment with their products.
The two leaders establish their interpretation of the vision, mission, and objectives involved in successfully
completing their products. The leaders use their interpretation to communicate and motivate their teams toward
the successful completion of their objectives


uu Knowledge and skills:
un The conductor is not expected to be able to play every instrument in the orchestra, but should possess
musical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The conductor provides the orchestra with leadership,
planning, and coordination through communications. The conductor provides written communication in the
form of musical scores and practice schedules. The conductor also communicates in real time with the team
by using a baton and other body movements.
un The project manager is not expected to perform every role on the project, but should possess project
management knowledge, technical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The project manager provides
the project team with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications. The project manager
provides written communications (e.g., documented plans and schedules) and communicates in real time
with the team using meetings and verbal or nonverbal cues.
The remainder of this section covers the key aspects of the role of the project manager. While there are thousands
of books and articles available on the subject, this section is not intended to cover the entire spectrum of information
available. Rather, it is designed to present an overview that will provide the practitioner with a basic understanding of
the subject in preparation for a more concentrated study on the various aspects discussed.
3.2 DEFINITION OF A PROJECT MANAGER
The role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager. Typically, the
functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. Operations managers
are responsible for ensuring that business operations are efficient. The project manager is the person assigned by the
performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.
3.3 THE PROJECT MANAGER’S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE

3.3.1 OVERVIEW
Project managers fulfill numerous roles within their sphere of influence. These roles reflect the project manager’s
capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession. This section
highlights the roles of the project manager in the various spheres of influence shown in Figure 3-1.

3.3.2 THE PROJECT
The project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The
project manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with the resources available.
The project manager also performs communication roles between the project sponsor, team members, and other
stakeholders. This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of success for the project. The project manager
uses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people) to balance the conflicting and competing
goals of the project stakeholders in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant
stakeholders support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement.
Research shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain essential skills. Research
reveals that the top 2% of project managers as designated by their bosses and team members distinguish themselves
by demonstrating superior relationship and communication skills while displaying a positive attitude [12].

The ability to communicate with stakeholders, including the team and sponsors applies across multiple aspects of
the project including, but not limited to, the following:
uu Developing finely tuned skills using multiple methods (e.g., verbal, written, and nonverbal);
uu Creating, maintaining, and adhering to communications plans and schedules;
uu Communicating predictably and consistently;
uu Seeking to understand the project stakeholders’ communication needs (communication may be the only
deliverable that some stakeholders received until the project’s end product or service is completed);
uu Making communications concise, clear, complete, simple, relevant, and tailored;
uu Including important positive and negative news;
uu Incorporating feedback channels; and
uu Relationship skills involving the development of extensive networks of people throughout the project manager’s
spheres of influence. These networks include formal networks such as organizational reporting structures.
However, the informal networks that project managers develop, maintain, and nurture are more important.
Informal networks include the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts
and influential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project manager to engage multiple
people in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies encountered in a project.


3.3.3 THE ORGANIZATION
The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent projects or projects that
are part of the same program may impact a project due to but not limited to the following:
uu Demands on the same resources,
uu Priorities of funding,
uu Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and
uu Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization.
Interacting with other project managers helps to create a positive influence for fulfilling the various needs of the
project. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or financial resources and deliverables required by the
team for project completion. The project manager seeks ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving
the goals and objectives of the project.

In addition, the project manager maintains a strong advocacy role within the organization. The project manager
proactively interacts with managers within the organization during the course of the project. The project manager also
works with the project sponsor to address internal political and strategic issues that may impact the team or the viability
or quality of the project.
The project manager may work toward increasing the project management competency and capability within the
organization as a whole and is involved in both tacit and explicit knowledge transfer or integration initiatives (see
Section 4.4 on Manage Project Knowledge). The project manager also works to:
uu Demonstrate the value of project management,
uu Increase acceptance of project management in the organization, and
uu Advance the efficacy of the PMO when one exists in the organization.
Depending on the organizational structure, a project manager may report to a functional manager. In other cases,
a project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a PMO or a portfolio or program manager
who is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-wide projects. The project manager works closely with all
relevant managers to achieve the project objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio
or program plan. The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational
managers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations, the project manager
may be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.


3.3.4 THE INDUSTRY
The project manager stays informed about current industry trends. The project manager takes this information and
sees how it may impact or apply to the current projects. These trends include but are not limited to:
uu Product and technology development;
uu New and changing market niches;
uu Standards (e.g., project management, quality management, information security management);
uu Technical support tools;
uu Economic forces that impact the immediate project;
uu Influences affecting the project management discipline; and
uu Process improvement and sustainability strategies.

3.3.5 PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE
Continuing knowledge transfer and integration is very important for the project manager. This professional
development is ongoing in the project management profession and in other areas where the project manager maintains
subject matter expertise. This knowledge transfer and integration includes but is not limited to:
uu Contribution of knowledge and expertise to others within the profession at the local, national, and global levels
(e.g., communities of practice, international organizations); and
uu Participation in training, continuing education, and development:
un In the project management profession (e.g., universities, PMI);
un In a related profession (e.g., systems engineering, configuration management); and
un In other professions (e.g., information technology, aerospace).
3.3.6 ACROSS DISCIPLINES
A professional project manager may choose to orient and educate other professionals regarding the value of a
project management approach to the organization. The project manager may serve as an informal ambassador by
educating the organization as to the advantages of project management with regard to timeliness, quality, innovation,
and resource management.


3.4 PROJECT MANAGER COMPETENCES
3.4.1 OVERVIEW
Recent PMI studies applied the Project Manager Competency Development (PMCD) Framework to the skills needed
by project managers through the use of The PMI Talent Triangle® shown in Figure 3-2. The talent triangle focuses on
three key skill sets:
uu Technical project management. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to specific domains of project,
program, and portfolio management. The technical aspects of performing one’s role.
uu Leadership. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to guide, motivate, and direct a team, to help an
organization achieve its business goals.
uu Strategic and business management. The knowledge of and expertise in the industry and organization that
enhanced performance and better delivers business outcomes.


While technical project management skills are core to program and project management, PMI research indicates that
they are not enough in today’s increasingly complicated and competitive global marketplace. Organizations are seeking
added skills in leadership and business intelligence. Members of various organizations state their belief that these
competencies can support longer-range strategic objectives that contribute to the bottom line. To be the most effective,
project managers need to have a balance of these three skill sets.


3.4.2 TECHNICAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILLS
Technical project management skills are defined as the skills to effectively apply project management knowledge
to deliver the desired outcomes for programs or projects. There are numerous technical project management skills.
The Knowledge Areas in this guide describe many of these necessary project management skills. Project managers
frequently rely on expert judgment to perform well. Being aware of personal expertise and where to find others with the
needed expertise are important for success as a project manager.
According to research. the top project managers consistently demonstrated several key skills including, but not
limited to, the ability to:
uu Focus on the critical technical project management elements for each project they manage. This focus is as
simple as having the right artifacts readily available. At the top of the list were the following:
un Critical success factors for the project,
un Schedule,
un Selected financial reports, and
un Issue log.
uu Tailor both traditional and agile tools, techniques, and methods for each project.
uu Make time to plan thoroughly and prioritize diligently.
uu Manage project elements, including, but not limited to, schedule, cost, resources, and risks.


3.4.3 STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SKILLS
Strategic and business management skills involve the ability to see the high-level overview of the organization and
effectively negotiate and implement decisions and actions that support strategic alignment and innovation. This ability
may include a working knowledge of other functions such as finance, marketing, and operations. Strategic and business
management skills may also include developing and applying pertinent product and industry expertise. This business
knowledge is also known as domain knowledge. Project managers should be knowledgeable enough about the business
to be able to:
uu Explain to others the essential business aspects of a project;
uu Work with the project sponsor, team, and subject matter experts to develop an appropriate project delivery
strategy; and
uu Implement that strategy in a way that maximizes the business value of the project.


In order to make the best decisions regarding the successful delivery of their projects, project managers should seek
out and consider the expertise of the operational managers who run the business in their organization. These managers
should know the work performed in their organization and how project plans will affect that work. The more the project
manager is able to know about the project’s subject matter, the better. At a minimum, the project manager should be
knowledgeable enough to explain to others the following aspects of the organization:
uu Strategy;
uu Mission;
uu Goals and objectives;
uu Products and services;
uu Operations (e.g., location, type, technology);
uu The market and the market condition, such as customers, state of the market (i.e., growing or shrinking), and
time-to-market factors, etc.; and
uu Competition (e.g., what, who, position in the market place).
The project manager should apply the following knowledge and information about the organization to the project to
ensure alignment:
uu Strategy,
uu Mission,
uu Goals and objectives,
uu Priority,
uu Tactics, and
uu Products or services (e.g., deliverables).


Strategic and business skills help the project manager to determine which business factors should be considered for
their project. The project manager determines how these business and strategic factors could affect the project while
understanding the interrelationship between the project and the organization. These factors include but are not limited to:
uu Risks and issues,
uu Financial implications,
uu Cost versus benefits analysis (e.g., net present value, return on investment), including the various options
considered,
uu Business value,
uu Benefits realization expectations and strategies, and
uu Scope, budget, schedule, and quality.
Through the application of this business knowledge, a project manager has the ability to make the appropriate
decisions and recommendations for a project. As conditions change, the project manager should be continuously
working with the project sponsor to keep the business and the project strategies aligned.


3.4.4 LEADERSHIP SKILLS
Leadership skills involve the ability to guide, motivate, and direct a team. These skills may include demonstrating
essential capabilities such as negotiation, resilience, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal
skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more complicated with more and more businesses executing their strategy
through projects. Project management is more than just working with numbers, templates, charts, graphs, and computing
systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. People can be counted, but they are not numbers.
3.4.4.1 DEALING WITH PEOPLE
A large part of the project manager’s role involves dealing with people. The project manager should study people’s
behaviors and motivations. The project manager should strive to be a good leader, because leadership is crucial to the
success of projects in organizations. A project manager applies leadership skills and qualities when working with all
project stakeholders, including the project team, the steering team, and project sponsors.


3.4.4.2 QUALITIES AND SKILLS OF A LEADER
Research shows that the qualities and skills of a leader include but are not limited to:
uu Being a visionary (e.g., help to describe the products, goals, and objectives of the project; able to dream and
translate those dreams for others);
uu Being optimistic and positive;
uu Being collaborative;
uu Managing relationships and conflict by:
un Building trust;
un Satisfying concerns;
un Seeking consensus;
un Balancing competing and opposing goals;
un Applying persuasion, negotiation, compromise, and conflict resolution skills;
un Developing and nurturing personal and professional networks;
un Taking a long-term view that relationships are just as important as the project; and
un Continuously developing and applying political acumen.
uu Communicating by:
un Spending sufficient time communicating (research shows that top project managers spend about 90% of
their time on a project in communicating);
un Managing expectations;
un Accepting feedback graciously;
un Giving feedback constructively; and
un Asking and listening.
uu Being respectful (helping others retain their autonomy), courteous, friendly, kind, honest, trustworthy, loyal,
and ethical;
uu Exhibiting integrity and being culturally sensitive, courageous, a problem solver, and decisive;
uu Giving credit to others where due;
uu Being a life-long learner who is results- and action-oriented;


u Focusing on the important things, including:
un Continuously prioritizing work by reviewing and adjusting as necessary;
un Finding and using a prioritization method that works for them and the project;
un Differentiating high-level strategic priorities, especially those related to critical success factors for the project;
un Maintaining vigilance on primary project constraints;
un Remaining flexible on tactical priorities; and
un Being able to sift through massive amounts of information to obtain the most important information.
uu Having a holistic and systemic view of the project, taking into account internal and external factors equally;
uu Being able to apply critical thinking (e.g., application of analytical methods to reach decisions) and identify him
or herself as a change agent.
uu Being able to build effective teams, be service-oriented, and have fun and share humor effectively with
team members.
3.4.4.3 POLITICS, POWER, AND GETTING THINGS DONE
Leadership and management are ultimately about being able to get things done. The skills and qualities noted help
the project manager to achieve the project goals and objectives. At the root of many of these skills and qualities is the
ability to deal with politics. Politics involves influence, negotiation, autonomy, and power.
Politics and its associated elements are not “good” or “bad,” “positive” or “negative” alone. The better the project
manager understands how the organization works, the more likely he or she will be successful. The project manager
observes and collects data about the project and organizational landscapes. The data then needs to be reviewed in the
context of the project, the people involved, the organization, and the environment as a whole. This review yields the
information and knowledge necessary for the project manager to plan and implement the most appropriate action. The
project manager’s action is a result of selecting the right kind of power to influence and negotiate with others. Exercise
of power also carries with it the responsibility of being sensitive to and respectful of other people. The effective action of
the project manager maintains the autonomy of those involved. The project manager’s action results in the right people
performing the activities necessary to fulfill the project’s objectives.


Power can originate with traits exhibited by the individual or the organization. Power is often supported by other
people’s perception of the leader. It is essential for project managers to be aware of their relationships with other people.
Relationships enable project managers to get things done on the project. There are numerous forms of power at the
disposal of project managers. Power and its use can be complex given its nature and the various factors at play in a
project. Various forms of power include but are not limited to:
uu Positional (sometimes called formal, authoritative, legitimate) (e.g., formal position granted in the organization
or team);
uu Informational (e.g., control of gathering or distribution);
uu Referent (e.g., respect or admiration others hold for the individual, credibility gained);
uu Situational (e.g., gained due to unique situation such as a specific crisis);
uu Personal or charismatic (e.g., charm, attraction);
uu Relational (e.g., participates in networking, connections, and alliances);
uu Expert (e.g., skill, information possessed; experience, training, education, certification);
uu Reward-oriented (e.g., ability to give praise, monetary or other desired items);
uu Punitive or coercive (e.g., ability to invoke discipline or negative consequences);
uu Ingratiating (e.g., application of flattery or other common ground to win favor or cooperation);
uu Pressure-based (e.g., limit freedom of choice or movement for the purpose of gaining compliance to desired action);
uu Guilt-based (e.g., imposition of obligation or sense of duty);
uu Persuasive (e.g., ability to provide arguments that move people to a desired course of action); and
uu Avoiding (e.g., refusing to participate).
Top project managers are proactive and intentional when it comes to power. These project managers will work to
acquire the power and authority they need within the boundaries of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures
rather than wait for it to be granted.


3.4.5 COMPARISON OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
The words leadership and management are often used interchangeably. However, they are not synonymous. The
word management is more closely associated with directing another person to get from one point to another using a
known set of expected behaviors. In contrast, leadership involves working with others through discussion or debate in
order to guide them from one point to another.
The method that a project manager chooses to employ reveals a distinct difference in behavior, self-perception, and
project role. Table 3-1 compares management and leadership on several important levels.
Project managers need to employ both leadership and management in order to be successful. The skill is in finding
the right balance for each situation. The way in which management and leadership are employed often shows up in the
project manager’s leadership style.


!!!!!!!!!! Table 3-1. Team Management and Team Leadership Compared

3.4.5.1 LEADERSHIP STYLES
Project managers may lead their teams in many ways. The style a project manager selects may be a personal
preference, or the result of the combination of multiple factors associated with the project. The style a project manager
uses may change over time based on the factors in play. Major factors to consider include but are not limited to:
uu Leader characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
uu Team member characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
uu Organizational characteristics (e.g., its purpose, structure, and type of work performed); and
uu Environmental characteristics (e.g., social situation, economic state, and political elements).
Research describes numerous leadership styles that a project manager can adopt. Some of the most common
examples of these styles include but are not limited to:
uu Laissez-faire (e.g., allowing the team to make their own decisions and establish their own goals, also referred to
as taking a hands-off style);
uu Transactional (e.g., focus on goals, feedback, and accomplishment to determine rewards; management
by exception);
uu Servant leader (e.g., demonstrates commitment to serve and put other people first; focuses on other people’s
growth, learning, development, autonomy, and well-being; concentrates on relationships, community and
collaboration; leadership is secondary and emerges after service);
uu Transformational (e.g., empowering followers through idealized attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation,
encouragement for innovation and creativity, and individual consideration);
uu Charismatic (e.g., able to inspire; is high-energy, enthusiastic, self-confident; holds strong convictions); and
uu Interactional (e.g., a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic).


3.4.5.2 PERSONALITY
Personality refers to the individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Personality
characteristics or traits include but are not limited to:
uu Authentic (e.g., accepts others for what and who they are, show open concern);
uu Courteous (e.g., ability to apply appropriate behavior and etiquette);
uu Creative (e.g., ability to think abstractly, to see things differently, to innovate);
uu Cultural (e.g., measure of sensitivity to other cultures including values, norms, and beliefs);
uu Emotional (e.g., ability to perceive emotions and the information they present and to manage them; measure of
interpersonal skills);
uu Intellectual (e.g., measure of human intelligence over multiple aptitudes);
uu Managerial (e.g., measure of management practice and potential);
uu Political (e.g., measure of political intelligence and making things happen);
uu Service-oriented (e.g., evidence of willingness to serve other people);
uu Social (e.g., ability to understand and manage people); and
uu Systemic (e.g., drive to understand and build systems).
An effective project manager will have some level of ability with each of these characteristics in order to be successful.
Each project, organization, and situation requires that the project manager emphasize different aspects of personality.


3.5 PERFORMING INTEGRATION
The role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project:
uu Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the strategic objectives and
ensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those of the portfolio, program, and business
areas. In this way, project managers contribute to the integration and execution of the strategy.
uu Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what is really essential at the
project level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, knowledge, and people.
Integration is a critical skill for project managers. Integration is covered more in depth in the Project Integration
Management Knowledge Area of this guide. Sections 3.5.1 through 3.5.4 focus on integration that takes place at
three different levels: the process, cognitive, and context levels. Section 3.5.4 concludes by addressing complexity
and integration.


3.5.1 PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL
Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project
objectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation of the project charter), but many others
overlap and occur several times throughout the project. One example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences
is a change in a requirement that impacts scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project
management processes such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may
involve a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for integrating
change requests.
Although there is no stated definition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small
chance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact


3.5.2 INTEGRATION AT THE COGNITIVE LEVEL
There are many different ways to manage a project, and the method selected typically depends on the specific
characteristics of the project including its size, how complicated the project or organization may be, and the culture of
the performing organization. It is clear that the personal skills and abilities of the project manager are closely related to
the way in which the project is managed.
The project manager should strive to become proficient in all of the Project Management Knowledge Areas. In concert
with proficiency in these Knowledge Areas, the project manager applies experience, insight, leadership, and technical
and business management skills to the project. Finally, it is through the project manager’s ability to integrate the
processes in these Knowledge Areas that makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.


3.5.3 INTEGRATION AT THE CONTEXT LEVEL
There have been many changes in the context in which business and projects take place today compared to a
few decades ago. New technologies have been introduced. Social networks, multicultural aspects, virtual teams, and
new values are part of the new reality of projects. An example is knowledge and people integration in the context of
a large cross-functional project implementation involving multiple organizations. The project manager considers the
implications of this context in communications planning and knowledge management for guiding the project team.
Project managers need to be cognizant of the project context and these new aspects when managing the
integration. Then project managers can decide how to best use these new elements of the environment in their
projects to achieve success.


3.5.4 INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY
Some projects may be referred to as complex and considered difficult to manage. In simple terms, complex and
complicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate or complicated.
Complexity within projects is a result of the organization’s system behavior, human behavior, and the uncertainty at
work in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [13], these three dimensions of
complexity are defined as:
uu System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems.
uu Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups.
uu Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion.
Complexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, and skill. Rather than
being complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. Portfolios, programs, and projects may
contain elements of complexity.
When approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider elements that are both inside and
outside of the project. The project manager should examine the characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity
as a characteristic or property of a project is typically defined as:
uu Containing multiple parts,
uu Possessing a number of connections between the parts,
uu Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and
uu Exhibiting behavior produced as a result of those interactions that cannot be explained as the simple sum of the
parts (e.g., emergent behavior).
Examining these various items that appear to make the project complex should help the project manager identify key
areas when planning, managing, and controlling the project to ensure integration.

4 PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
Project Integration Management includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify, and
coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups. In
the project management context, integration includes characteristics of unification, consolidation, communication, and
interrelationship. These actions should be applied from the start of the project through completion. Project Integration
Management includes making choices about:
uu Resource allocation,
uu Balancing competing demands,
uu Examining any alternative approaches,
uu Tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives, and
uu Managing the interdependencies among the Project Management Knowledge Areas.


The Project Integration Management processes are:
4.1 Develop Project Charter—The process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of
a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
4.2 Develop Project Management Plan—The process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all plan components
and consolidating them into an integrated project management plan.
4.3 Direct and Manage Project Work—The process of leading and performing the work defined in the project
management plan and implementing approved changes to achieve the project’s objectives.
4.4 Manage Project Knowledge—The process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve
the project’s objectives and contribute to organizational learning.
4.5 Monitor and Control Project Work—The process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting overall progress to meet
the performance objectives defined in the project management plan.
4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control—The process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and
managing changes to deliverables, organizational process assets, project documents, and the project management
plan; and communicating the decisions.
4.7 Close Project or Phase—The process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract.
Figure 4-1 provides an overview of the Project Integration Management processes. The Project Integration
Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap
and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.

Project Integration Management is specific to project managers. Whereas other Knowledge Areas may be managed
by specialists (e.g., cost analysis, scheduling specialists, risk management experts), the accountability of Project
Integration Management cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one who combines the results
in all the other Knowledge Areas and has the overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible
for the project as a whole.
Projects and project management are integrative by nature. For example, a cost estimate needed for a contingency
plan involves integrating the processes in the Project Cost Management, Project Schedule Management, and Project
Risk Management Knowledge Areas. When additional risks associated with various staffing alternatives are identified,
then one or more of those processes may be revisited.
The links among the processes in the Project Management Process Groups are often iterative. For example, the
Planning Process Group provides the Executing Process Group with a documented project management plan early in the
project and then updates the project management plan if changes occur as the project progresses.
Project Integration Management is about:
uu Ensuring that the deliverable due dates of the product, service, or result; project life cycle; and the benefits
management plan are aligned;
uu Providing a project management plan to achieve the project objectives;
uu Ensuring the creation and the use of the appropriate knowledge to and from the project as necessary;
uu Managing the performance and changes of the activities in the project management plan;
uu Making integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;
uu Measuring and monitoring the project’s progress and taking appropriate action to meet project objectives;
uu Collecting data on the results achieved, analyzing the data to obtain information, and communicating this
information to relevant stakeholders;
uu Completing all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, contract, and the project as a whole;
and
uu Managing phase transitions when necessary.
The more complex the project and the more varied the expectations of the stakeholders, the more a sophisticated
approach to integration is needed.


TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area requires combining the results from all the other Knowledge
Areas. Evolving trends in integration processes include but are not limited to:
uu Use of automated tools. The volume of data and information that project managers need to integrate makes it
necessary to use a project management information system (PMIS) and automated tools to collect, analyze, and
use information to meet project objectives and realize project benefits.
uu Use of visual management tools. Some project teams use visual management tools, rather than written plans
and other documents, to capture and oversee critical project elements. Making key project elements visible to
the entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates knowledge transfer, and empowers
team members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.
uu Project knowledge management. The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous
process of identifying knowledge throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so
that the knowledge is not lost.
uu Expanding the project manager’s responsibilities. Project managers are being called on to initiate and finalize
the project, such as project business case development and benefits management. Historically, these activities
have been the responsibility of management and the project management office, but project managers are more
frequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver benefits. Project managers are
also engaging in more comprehensive identification and engagement of stakeholders. This includes managing
the interfaces with various functional and operational departments and senior management personnel.
uu Hybrid methodologies. Some project management methodologies are evolving to incorporate successfully
applied new practices. Examples include the use of agile and other iterative practices; business analysis
techniques for requirements management; tools for identifying complex elements in projects; and organizational
change management methods to prepare for transitioning the project outputs into the organization.


TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS
Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Integration Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
uu Project life cycle. What is an appropriate project life cycle? What phases should comprise the project life cycle?
uu Development life cycle. What development life cycle and approach are appropriate for the product, service,
or result? Is a predictive or adaptive approach appropriate? If adaptive, should the product be developed
incrementally or iteratively? Is a hybrid approach best?
uu Management approaches. What management processes are most effective based on the organizational culture
and the complexity of the project?
uu Knowledge management. How will knowledge be managed in the project to foster a collaborative working
environment?
uu Change. How will change be managed in the project?
uu Governance. What control boards, committees, and other stakeholders are part of the project? What are the
project status reporting requirements?
uu Lessons learned. What information should be collected throughout and at the end of the project? How will
historical information and lessons learned be made available to future projects?
uu Benefits. When and how should benefits be reported: at the end of the project or at the end of each iteration
or phase?


CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
Iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration
management. The team members determine how plans and components should integrate.
The expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key Concepts for Integration Management do not change in
an adaptive environment, but control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project
manager’s focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to
respond to changes. This collaborative approach can be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill
base rather than a narrow specialization.

4.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER
Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project
and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The key
benefits of this process are that it provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the
organization, creates a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project. This
process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
process are depicted in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Figure 4-3. Develop Project Charter: Data Flow Diagram

The project charter establishes a partnership between the performing and requesting organizations. In the case
of external projects, a formal contract is typically the preferred way to establish an agreement. A project charter may
still be used to establish internal agreements within an organization to ensure proper delivery under the contract. The
approved project charter formally initiates the project. A project manager is identified and assigned as early in the
project as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the start of planning.
The project charter can be developed by the sponsor or the project manager in collaboration with the initiating entity.
This collaboration allows the project manager to have a better understanding of the project purpose, objectives, and
expected benefits. This understanding will better allow for efficient resource allocation to project activities. The project
charter provides the project manager with the authority to plan, execute, and control the project.
Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor, program, or project management office
(PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should
be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Projects are initiated due to
internal business needs or external influences. These needs or influences often trigger the creation of a needs analysis,
feasibility study, business case, or description of the situation that the project will address. Chartering a project validates
alignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the organization. A project charter is not considered to be
a contract because there is no consideration or money promised or exchanged in its creation.


4.1.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: INPUTS
4.1.1.1 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
The business case (described in Section 1.2.6.1) and the benefits management plan (described in Section 1.2.6.2)
are sources of information about the project´s objectives and how the project will contribute to the business goals.
Although the business documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically.
uu Business case. The approved business case, or similar, is the business document most commonly used to
create the project charter. The business case describes the necessary information from a business standpoint to
determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. It is commonly used for
decision making by managers or executives above the project level. Typically, the business need and the costbenefit analysis are contained in the business case to justify and establish boundaries for the project. For more
information on the business case, see Section 1.2.6.1. The business case is created as a result of one or more
of the following:

un Market demand (e.g., an automobile manufacturer authorizing a project to build more fuel-efficient cars in
response to gasoline shortages),
un Organizational need (e.g., due to high overhead costs, a company may combine staff functions and streamline
processes to reduce costs),
un Customer request (e.g., an electric utility authorizing a project to build a new substation to serve a new
industrial park),
un Technological advance (e.g., an airline authorizing a new project to develop electronic tickets instead of paper
tickets based on technological advances),
un Legal requirement (e.g., a paint manufacturer authorizing a project to establish guidelines for handling
toxic materials),
un Ecological impacts (e.g., a company authorizing a project to lessen its environmental impact), or
un Social need (e.g., a nongovernmental organization in a developing country authorizing a project to
provide potable water systems, latrines, and sanitation education to communities suffering from high
rates of cholera).
The project charter incorporates the appropriate information for the project from the business documents. The project
manager does not update or modify the business documents since they are not project documents; however, the project
manager may make recommendations.


4.1.1.2 AGREEMENTS
Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements are used to define initial intentions for a project. Agreements may take
the form of contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), service level agreements (SLA), letters of agreement,
letters of intent, verbal agreements, email, or other written agreements. Typically, a contract is used when a project is
being performed for an external customer.
4.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Project Charter process include but are not
limited to:
uu Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship
standards),
uu Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints,
uu Marketplace conditions,
uu Organizational culture and political climate,
uu Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through
people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals), and
uu Stakeholders’ expectations and risk thresholds


4.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Project Charter process include but are not
limited to:
uu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;
uu Portfolio, program, and project governance framework (governance functions and processes to provide guidance
and decision making);
uu Monitoring and reporting methods;
uu Templates (e.g., project charter template); and
uu Historical information and lessons learned repository (e.g., project records and documents, information about the
results of previous project selection decisions, and information about previous project performance).
4.1.2 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Expert judgment is defined as judgment provided based upon expertise in an application area, Knowledge Area,
discipline, industry, etc., as appropriate for the activity being performed. Such expertise may be provided by any group
or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training.
For this process, expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of or training
in the following topics:
uu Organizational strategy,
uu Benefits management,
uu Technical knowledge of the industry and focus area of the project,
uu Duration and budget estimation, and
uu Risk identification.


4.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING
Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Brainstorming. This technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of time. It is conducted in a
group environment and is led by a facilitator. Brainstorming comprises two parts: idea generation and analysis.
Brainstorming can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and
team members when developing the project charter.
uu Focus groups. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Focus groups bring together stakeholders and subject matter
experts to learn about the perceived project risk, success criteria, and other topics in a more conversational way
than a one-on-one interview.
uu Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain information on high-level requirements,
assumptions or constraints, approval criteria, and other information from stakeholders by talking directly to them.
4.1.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS
Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Conflict management. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. Conflict management can be used to help bring
stakeholders into alignment on the objectives, success criteria, high-level requirements, project description,
summary milestones, and other elements of the charter.
uu Facilitation. Facilitation is the ability to effectively guide a group event to a successful decision, solution,
or conclusion. A facilitator ensures that there is effective participation, that participants achieve a mutual
understanding, that all contributions are considered, that conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the
decision process established for the project, and that the actions and agreements achieved are appropriately
dealt with afterward.
uu Meeting management. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Meeting management includes preparing the agenda,
ensuring that a representative for each key stakeholder group is invited, and preparing and sending the follow-up
minutes and actions.
4.1.2.4 MEETINGS
For this process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify the project objectives, success criteria, key
deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information.


4.1.3 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: OUTPUTS
4.1.3.1 PROJECT CHARTER
The project charter is the document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
It documents the high-level information on the project and on the product, service, or result the project is intended to
satisfy, such as:
uu Project purpose;
uu Measurable project objectives and related success criteria;
uu High-level requirements;
uu High-level project description, boundaries, and key deliverables;
uu Overall project risk;
uu Summary milestone schedule;
uu Preapproved financial resources;
uu Key stakeholder list;
uu Project approval requirements (i.e., what constitutes project success, who decides the project is successful, and
who signs off on the project);
uu Project exit criteria (i.e., what are the conditions to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase);
uu Assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority level; and
uu Name and authority of the sponsor or other person(s) authorizing the project charter.
At a high level, the project charter ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of the key deliverables,
milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.


4.1.3 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: OUTPUTS
4.1.3.1 PROJECT CHARTER
The project charter is the document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
It documents the high-level information on the project and on the product, service, or result the project is intended to
satisfy, such as:
uu Project purpose;
uu Measurable project objectives and related success criteria;
uu High-level requirements;
uu High-level project description, boundaries, and key deliverables;
uu Overall project risk;
uu Summary milestone schedule;
uu Preapproved financial resources;
uu Key stakeholder list;
uu Project approval requirements (i.e., what constitutes project success, who decides the project is successful, and
who signs off on the project);
uu Project exit criteria (i.e., what are the conditions to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase);
uu Assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority level; and
uu Name and authority of the sponsor or other person(s) authorizing the project charter.
At a high level, the project charter ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of the key deliverables,
milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.
4.1.3.2 ASSUMPTION LOG
High-level strategic and operational assumptions and constraints are normally identified in the business case before
the project is initiated and will flow into the project charter. Lower-level activity and task assumptions are generated
throughout the project such as defining technical specifications, estimates, the schedule, risks, etc. The assumption log
is used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle.

4.2 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Develop Project Management Plan is the process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all plan components and
consolidating them into an integrated project management plan. The key benefit of this process is the production of a
comprehensive document that defines the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are
depicted in Figure 4-4. Figure 4-5 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.


!!!!! Figure 4-4. Develop Project Management Plan: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs


!!!!!! Figure 4-5. Develop Project Management Plan: Data Flow Diagram

The project management plan defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project
management plan’s content varies depending on the application area and complexity of the project.
The project management plan may be either summary level or detailed. Each component plan is described to the
extent required by the specific project. The project management plan should be robust enough to respond to an everchanging project environment. This agility may result in more accurate information as the project progresses.
The project management plan should be baselined; that is, it is necessary to define at least the project references
for scope, time, and cost, so that the project execution can be measured and compared to those references and
performance can be managed. Before the baselines are defined, the project management plan may be updated as
many times as necessary. No formal process is required at that time. But, once it is baselined, it may only be changed
through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Consequently, change requests will be generated and decided
upon whenever a change is requested. This results in a project management plan that is progressively elaborated by
controlled and approved updates extending through project closure.
Projects that exist in the context of a program or portfolio should develop a project management plan that is consistent
with the program or portfolio management plan. For example, if the program management plan indicates all changes
exceeding a specified cost need to be reviewed by the change control board (CCB), then this process and cost threshold
need to be defined in the project management plan.


4.2.1 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: INPUTS
4.2.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER
Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project team uses the project charter as a starting point for initial project planning.
The type and amount of information in the project charter varies depending on the complexity of the project and the
information known at the time of its creation. At a minimum, the project charter should define the high-level information
about the project that will be elaborated in the various components of the project management plan.
4.2.1.2 OUTPUTS FROM OTHER PROCESSES
Outputs from many of the other processes described in Sections 5 through 13 are integrated to create the project
management plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are an output from other planning processes are inputs to this
process. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project management plan.


4.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Project Management Plan process include but
are not limited to:
uu Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship
standards);
uu Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints;
uu Project management body of knowledge for vertical market (e.g., construction) and/or focus area (e.g.,
environmental, safety, risk, or agile software development);
uu Organizational structure, culture, management practices, and sustainability;
uu Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through
people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals); and
uu Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and capital equipment).
4.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Project Management Plan process include but are
not limited to:
uu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;
uu Project management plan template, including:
un Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes to satisfy the specific needs
of the project, and
un Project closure guidelines or requirements such as the product validation and acceptance criteria.
uu Change control procedures, including the steps by which official organizational standards, policies, plans,
procedures, or any project documents will be modified and how any changes will be approved and validated;
uu Monitoring and reporting methods, risk control procedures, and communication requirements;
uu Project information from previous similar projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule and performance measurement
baselines, project calendars, project schedule network diagrams, and risk registers); and
uu Historical information and lessons learned repository.


4.2.2 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized
knowledge of or training in the following topics:
uu Tailoring the project management process to meet the project needs, including the dependencies and interactions
among those processes and the essential inputs and outputs;
uu Developing additional components of the project management plan if needed;
uu Determining the tools and techniques to be used for accomplishing those processes;
uu Developing technical and management details to be included in the project management plan;
uu Determining resources and skill levels needed to perform project work;
uu Defining the level of configuration management to apply on the project;
uu Determining which project documents will be subject to the formal change control process; and
uu Prioritizing the work on the project to ensure the project resources are allocated to the appropriate work at the
appropriate time.


4.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING
Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is frequently used when developing the project
management plan to gather ideas and solutions about the project approach. Attendees include the project team
members although other subject matter experts (SMEs) or stakeholders may also participate.
uu Checklists. Described in Section 11.2.2.2. Many organizations have standardized checklists available based in
their own experience or use checklists from the industry. A checklist may guide the project manager to develop
the plan or may help to verify that all the required information is included in the project management plan.
uu Focus groups. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Focus groups bring together stakeholders to discuss the project
management approach and the integration of the different components of the project management plan.
uu Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain specific information from stakeholders to
develop the project management plan or any component plan or project document.


4.2.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS
The interpersonal and team skills used when developing the project management plan include:
uu Conflict management. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. Conflict management may be necessary to bring diverse
stakeholders into alignment on all aspects of the project management plan.
uu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation ensures that there is effective participation, that participants
achieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full
buy-in according to the decision process established for the project.
uu Meeting management. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Meeting management is necessary to ensure that the
numerous meetings that are necessary to develop, unify, and agree on the project management plan are well run.
4.2.2.4 MEETINGS
For this process, meetings are used to discuss the project approach, determine how work will be executed to
accomplish the project objectives, and establish the way the project will be monitored and controlled.
The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. Its purpose is
to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and
responsibilities of each stakeholder. The kick-off may occur at different points in time depending on the characteristics
of the project:
uu For small projects, there is usually only one team that performs the planning and the execution. In this case, the
kick-off occurs shortly after initiation, in the Planning Process Group, because the team is involved in planning.
uu In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the
project team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation.
In this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group.
Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.

4.2.3 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: OUTPUTS
4.2.3.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
The project management plan is the document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored and
controlled, and closed. It integrates and consolidates all of the subsidiary management plans and baselines, and other
information necessary to manage the project. The needs of the project determine which components of the project
management plan are needed.


Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Subsidiary management plans:
un Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. Establishes how the scope will be defined, developed,
monitored, controlled, and validated.
un Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. Establishes how the requirements will be
analyzed, documented, and managed.
un Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. Establishes the criteria and the activities for
developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule.
un Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Establishes how the costs will be planned, structured,
and controlled.
un Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. Establishes how an organization´s quality policies,
methodologies, and standards will be implemented in the project.
un Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1 Provides guidance on how project resources should
be categorized, allocated, managed, and released.
un Communications management plan. Described in Section 10.1.3.1. Establishes how, when, and by whom
information about the project will be administered and disseminated.
un Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Establishes how the risk management activities will
be structured and performed.
un Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. Establishes how the project team will acquire
goods and services from outside of the performing organization.
un Stakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. Establishes how stakeholders will be engaged
in project decisions and execution, according to their needs, interests, and impact.
uu Baselines:
un Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The approved version of a scope statement, work breakdown
structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary, which is used as a basis for comparison.
un Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The approved version of the schedule model that is used as
a basis for comparison to the actual results.
un Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The approved version of the time-phased project budget that is
used as a basis for comparison to the actual results.


uu Additional components. Most components of the project management plan are produced as outputs from other
processes, though some are produced during this process. Those components developed as part of this process
will be dependent on the project; however, they often include but are not limited to:
un Change management plan. Describes how the change requests throughout the project will be formally
authorized and incorporated.
un Configuration management plan. Describes how the information about the items of the project (and which
items) will be recorded and updated so that the product, service, or result of the project remains consistent
and/or operative.
un Performance measurement baseline. An integrated scope-schedule-cost plan for the project work against
which project execution is compared to measure and manage performance.
un Project life cycle. Describes the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure.
un Development approach. Describes the product, service, or result development approach, such as predictive,
iterative, agile, or a hybrid model.
un Management reviews. Identifies the points in the project when the project manager and relevant stakeholders
will review the project progress to determine if performance is as expected, or if preventive or corrective
actions are necessary.
While the project management plan is one of the primary documents used to manage the project, other project
documents are also used. These other documents are not part of the project management plan; however, they are
necessary to manage the project effectively. Table 4-1 is a representative list of the project management plan components
and project documents.

!!!!!!!! Table 4-1. Project Management Plan and Project Documents


4.3 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK
Direct and Manage Project Work is the process of leading and performing the work defined in the project management
plan and implementing approved changes to achieve the project’s objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it
provides overall management of the project work and deliverables, thus improving the probability of project success.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are
depicted in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-7 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.


!!!!!! Figure 4-6. Direct and Manage Project Work: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!! Figure 4-7. Direct and Manage Project Work: Data Flow Diagram


Direct and Manage Project Work involves executing the planned project activities to complete project deliverables
and accomplish established objectives. Available resources are allocated, their efficient use is managed, and changes in
project plans stemming from analyzing work performance data and information are carried out. The Direct and Manage
Project Work process is directly affected by the project application area. Deliverables are produced as outputs from
processes performed to accomplish the project work as planned and scheduled in the project management plan.
The project manager, along with the project management team, directs the performance of the planned project
activities and manages the various technical and organizational interfaces that exist in the project. Direct and Manage
Project Work also requires review of the impact of all project changes and the implementation of approved changes:
corrective action, preventive action, and/or defect repair.
During project execution, the work performance data is collected and communicated to the applicable controlling
processes for analysis. Work performance data analysis provides information about the completion status of deliverables
and other relevant details about project performance. The work performance data will also be used as an input to the
Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, and can be used as feedback into lessons learned to improve the performance
of future work packages.


4.3.1 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: INPUTS
4.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Any component of the project management plan may be an input to this process.
4.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Change log. Described in Section 4.6.3.3. The change log contains the status of all change requests.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned are used to improve the performance
of the project and to avoid repeating mistakes. The register helps identify where to set rules or guidelines so the
team’s actions are aligned.
uu Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list shows the scheduled dates for specific milestones.
uu Project communications. Described in Section 10.2.3.1. Project communications include performance reports,
deliverable status, and other information generated by the project.


uu Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes at least the list of work activities, their
durations, resources, and planned start and finish dates.
uu Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix links
product requirements to the deliverables that satisfy them and helps to focus on the final outcomes.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides information on threats and opportunities
that may impact project execution.
uu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report provides information on sources of overall project risk
along with summary information on identified individual project risks.


4.3.1.3 APPROVED CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.6.3.1. Approved change requests are an output of the Perform Integrated Change Control
process, and include those requests reviewed and approved for implementation by the project manager or by the
change control board (CCB) when applicable. The approved change request may be a corrective action, a preventive
action, or a defect repair. Approved change requests are scheduled and implemented by the project team and can
impact any area of the project or project management plan. The approved change requests can also modify the formally
controlled project management plan components or project documents.


4.3.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Direct and Manage Project Work process include but are
not limited to:
uu Organizational structure, culture, management practices, and sustainability;
uu Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and capital equipment); and
uu Stakeholder risk thresholds (e.g., allowable cost overrun percentage).

4.3.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Direct and Manage Project Work process include but are
not limited to:
uu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;
uu Issue and defect management procedures defining issue and defect controls, issue and defect identification and
resolution, and action item tracking;
uu Issue and defect management database(s) containing historical issue and defect status, issue and defect
resolution, and action item results;
uu Performance measurement database used to collect and make available measurement data on processes and
products;
uu Change control and risk control procedures; and
uu Project information from previous projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule, performance measurement baselines,
project calendars, project schedule network diagrams, risk registers, risk reports, and lessons learned repository).


4.3.2 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
uu Technical knowledge on the industry and focus area of the project,
uu Cost and budget management,
uu Legal and procurement,
uu Legislation and regulations, and
uu Organizational governance.


4.3.2.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)
The PMIS provides access to information technology (IT) software tools, such as scheduling software tools, work
authorization systems, configuration management systems, information collection and distribution systems, as well as
interfaces to other online automated systems such as corporate knowledge base repositories. Automated gathering and
reporting on key performance indicators (KPI) can be part of this system.


4.3.2.3 MEETINGS
Meetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics of the project when directing and managing project work.
Attendees may include the project manager, the project team, and appropriate stakeholders involved or affected by
the topics addressed. Each attendee should have a defined role to ensure appropriate participation. Types of meetings
include but are not limited to: kick-off, technical, sprint or iteration planning, Scrum daily standups, steering group,
problem solving, progress update, and retrospective meetings.
4.3.3 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: OUTPUTS
4.3.3.1 DELIVERABLES
A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be
produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables are typically the outcomes of the project and can include
components of the project management plan.
Change control should be applied once the first version of a deliverable has been completed. The control of the multiple
versions or editions of a deliverable (e.g., documents, software, and building blocks) is supported by configuration
management tools and procedures.


4.3.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA
Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements identified during activities being performed
to carry out the project work. Data are often viewed as the lowest level of detail from which information is derived by
other processes. Data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes for further analysis.
Examples of work performance data include work completed, key performance indicators (KPIs), technical performance
measures, actual start and finish dates of schedule activities, story points completed, deliverables status, schedule
progress, number of change requests, number of defects, actual costs incurred, actual durations, etc.


4.3.3.3 ISSUE LOG
Throughout the life cycle of a project, the project manager will normally face problems, gaps, inconsistencies, or
conflicts that occur unexpectedly and that require some action so they do not impact the project performance. The issue
log is a project document where all the issues are recorded and tracked. Data on issues may include:
uu Issue type,
uu Who raised the issue and when,
uu Description,
uu Priority,
uu Who is assigned to the issue,
uu Target resolution date,
uu Status, and
uu Final solution.
The issue log will help the project manager effectively track and manage issues, ensuring that they are investigated
and resolved. The issue log is created for the first time as an output of this process, although issues may happen at
any time during the project. The issue log is updated as a result of the monitoring and control activities throughout the
project’s life cycle.


4.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS
A change request is a formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline. When issues are found while
project work is being performed, change requests can be submitted, which may modify project policies or procedures,
project or product scope, project cost or budget, project schedule, or quality of the project or product results. Other
change requests cover the needed preventive or corrective actions to forestall negative impact later in the project.
Any project stakeholder may request a change. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the
Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Change requests can be initiated from inside or outside the
project and they can be optional or legally/contractually mandated. Change requests may include:


uu Corrective action. An intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project
management plan.
uu Preventive action. An intentional activity that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with
the project management plan.
uu Defect repair. An intentional activity to modify a nonconforming product or product component.
uu Updates. Changes to formally controlled project documents, plans, etc., to reflect modified or additional ideas
or content.


4.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Any component of the project management plan may require a change request as a result of this process.
4.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be updated with additional or modified activities
to be performed to complete project work.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. New assumptions and constraints may be added, and the status
of existing assumptions and constraints may be updated or closed out.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Any lessons learned that will improve performance for
current or future projects is recorded as it is learned.
uu Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. New requirements may be identified during this
process. Progress on meeting requirements can also be updated.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks may be identified and existing risks may be updated
during this process. Risks are recorded in the risk register via risk management processes.
uu Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. Where additional information on existing or new stakeholders
is gathered as a result of this process, it is recorded in the stakeholder register.
4.3.3.7 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES
Any organizational process asset can be updated as a result of this process.


4.4 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE
Manage Project Knowledge is the process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve the
project’s objectives and contribute to organizational learning. The key benefits of this process are that prior organizational
knowledge is leveraged to produce or improve the project outcomes, and knowledge created by the project is available
to support organizational operations and future projects or phases. This process is performed throughout the project.
The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-8. Figure 4-9 depicts the data flow
diagram for the process.


!!!!!! Figure 4-8. Manage Project Knowledge: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs


!!!!!! Figure 4-9. Manage Project Knowledge: Data Flow Diagram

Knowledge is commonly split into “explicit” (knowledge that can be readily codified using words, pictures, and
numbers) and “tacit” (knowledge that is personal and difficult to express, such as beliefs, insights, experience,
and “know-how”). Knowledge management is concerned with managing both tacit and explicit knowledge for two
purposes: reusing existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin both purposes are
knowledge sharing and knowledge integration (of knowledge from different domains, contextual knowledge, and project
management knowledge).
It is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it so it can be shared. Another
common misconception is that managing knowledge involves just obtaining lessons learned at the end of the project,
in order to use it in the future projects. Only codified explicit knowledge can be shared in this way. But codified explicit
knowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations, so even though it can easily be shared, it isn’t always
understood or applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has context built in but is very difficult to codify. It resides in
the minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations, and is normally shared through conversations and
interactions between people.
From an organizational perspective, knowledge management is about making sure the skills, experience, and expertise
of the project team and other stakeholders are used before, during, and after the project. Because knowledge resides in
the minds of people and people cannot be forced to share what they know (or to pay attention to others’ knowledge), the
most important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share
their knowledge. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not work if people are not motivated
to share what they know or to pay attention to what others know. In practice, knowledge is shared using a mixture of
knowledge management tools and techniques (interactions between people) and information management tools and
techniques (in which people codify part of their explicit knowledge by documenting it so it can be shared).

4.4.1 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: INPUTS
4.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. All components of the project management plan are inputs.

4.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register provides information on
effective practices in knowledge management.
uu Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. Project team assignments provide information on the
type of competencies and experience available in the project and the knowledge that may be missing.
uu Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure includes
information on the composition of the team and may help to understand what knowledge is available as a group
and what knowledge is missing.
uu Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register contains details about the identified
stakeholders to help understand the knowledge they may have.
4.4.1.3 DELIVERABLES
A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be
produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables are typically tangible components completed to meet
the project objectives and can include components of the project management plan.
4.4.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Manage Project Knowledge process include but are not
limited to:
uu Organizational, stakeholder, and customer culture. The existence of trusting working relationships and a
no-blame culture is particularly important in managing knowledge. Other factors include the value placed on
learning and social behavioral norms.
uu Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. The location of team members helps determine methods
for gaining and sharing knowledge.
uu Organizational knowledge experts. Some organizations have a team or individual that specializes in knowledge
management.
uu Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints. These include confidentiality of project information.


4.4.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
Knowledge about project management is often embedded in processes and routines. The organizational process
assets that can influence the Manage Project Knowledge process include but are not limited to:
uu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures. These may include: confidentiality and access
to information; security and data protection; record retention policies; use of copyrighted information; destruction
of classified information; format and maximum size of files; registry data and metadata; authorized technology
and social media; etc.
uu Personnel administration. These include, for example, employee development and training records, and
competency frameworks that refer to knowledge-sharing behaviors.
uu Organizational communication requirements. Formal, rigid communication requirements are good for sharing
information. Informal communication is more effective for creating new knowledge and integrating knowledge
across diverse stakeholder groups.
uu Formal knowledge-sharing and information-sharing procedures. These include learning reviews before,
during, and after projects and project phases; for example, identifying, capturing, and sharing lessons learned
from the current project and other projects.


4.4.2 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
uu Knowledge management,
uu Information management,
uu Organizational learning,
uu Knowledge and information management tools, and
uu Relevant information from other projects.
4.4.2.2 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
Knowledge management tools and techniques connect people so they can work together to create new knowledge,
share tacit knowledge, and integrate the knowledge of diverse team members. The tools and techniques appropriate in
a project depend on the nature of the project, especially the degree of innovation involved, the project complexity, and
the level of diversity (including diversity of disciplines) among team members.


Tools and techniques include but are not limited to:
uu Networking, including informal social interaction and online social networking. Online forums where people
can ask open questions (“What does anyone know about…?”) are useful for starting knowledge-sharing
conversations with specialists;
uu Communities of practice (sometimes called communities of interest or just communities) and special
interest groups;
uu Meetings, including virtual meetings where participants can interact using communications technology;
uu Work shadowing and reverse shadowing;
uu Discussion forums such as focus groups;
uu Knowledge-sharing events such as seminars and conferences;
uu Workshops, including problem-solving sessions and learning reviews designed to identify lessons learned;
uu Storytelling;
uu Creativity and ideas management techniques;
uu Knowledge fairs and cafés; and
uu Training that involves interaction between learners.
All of these tools and techniques can be applied face-to-face or virtually, or both. Face-to-face interaction is usually
the most effective way to build the trusting relationships that are needed to manage knowledge. Once relationships are
established, virtual interaction can be used to maintain the relationship.

4.4.2.3 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Information management tools and techniques are used to create and connect people to information. They are
effective for sharing simple, unambiguous, codified explicit knowledge. They include but are not limited to:
uu Methods for codifying explicit knowledge; for example, for producing lessons to be learned entries for the lessons
learned register;
uu Lessons learned register;
uu Library services;
uu Information gathering, for example, web searches and reading published articles; and
uu Project management information system (PMIS). Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information
systems often include document management systems.
Tools and techniques that connect people to information can be enhanced by adding an element of interaction, for
example, include a “contact me” function so users can get in touch with the originators of the lessons and ask for advice
specific to their project and context.


Interaction and support also helps people find relevant information. Asking for help is generally quicker and easier
than trying to identify search terms. Search terms are often difficult to select because people may not know which
keywords or key phrases to use to access the information they need.
Knowledge and information management tools and techniques should be connected to project processes and process
owners. Communities of practice and subject matter experts (SMEs), for example, may generate insights that lead
to improved control processes; having an internal sponsor can ensure improvements are implemented. Lessons learned
register entries may be analyzed to identify common issues that can be addressed by changes to project procedures.


4.4.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS
The interpersonal and team skills used include but are not limited to:
uu Active listening. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Active listening helps reduce misunderstandings and improves
communication and knowledge sharing.
uu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation helps effectively guide a group to a successful decision,
solution, or conclusion.
uu Leadership. Described in Section 3.4.4. Leadership is used to communicate the vision and inspire the project
team to focus on the appropriate knowledge and knowledge objectives.
uu Networking. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Networking allows informal connections and relations among project
stakeholders to be established and creates the conditions to share tacit and explicit knowledge.
uu Political awareness. Described in Section 10.1.2.6. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan
communications based on the project environment as well as the organization’s political environment.

4.4.3 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: OUTPUTS
4.4.3.1 LESSONS LEARNED REGISTER
The lessons learned register can include the category and description of the situation. The lessons learned register
may also include the impact, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. The lessons learned
register may record challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other content as appropriate.
The lessons learned register is created as an output of this process early in the project. Thereafter it is used as an
input and updated as an output in many processes throughout the project. The persons or teams involved in the work are
also involved in capturing the lessons learned. Knowledge can be documented using videos, pictures, audios, or other
suitable means that ensure the efficiency of the lessons captured.
At the end of a project or phase, the information is transferred to an organizational process asset called a lessons
learned repository.

4.4.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Any component of the project management plan may be updated as a result of this process.
4.4.3.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES
All projects create new knowledge. Some of this knowledge is codified, embedded in deliverables, or embedded in
improvements to processes and procedures as a result of the Manage Project Knowledge process. Existing knowledge
can also be codified or embedded for the first time as a result of this process; for example, if an existing idea for a new
procedure is piloted in the project and found to be successful.
Any organizational process asset can be updated as a result of this process.
4.5 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK
Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet
the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. The key benefits of this process are that it allows
stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance
issues, and to have visibility into the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts. This process is performed
throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-10. Figure
4-11 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

!!!!!!!!! Figure 4-10. Monitor and Control Project Work: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!!! Figure 4-11. Monitor and Control Project Work: Data Flow Diagram


Monitoring is an aspect of project management performed throughout the project. Monitoring includes collecting,
measuring, and assessing measurements and trends to effect process improvements. Continuous monitoring gives
the project management team insight into the health of the project and identifies any areas that may require special
attention. Control includes determining corrective or preventive actions or replanning and following up on action plans
to determine whether the actions taken resolved the performance issue. The Monitor and Control Project Work process
is concerned with:
uu Comparing actual project performance against the project management plan;
uu Assessing performance periodically to determine whether any corrective or preventive actions are indicated, and
then recommending those actions as necessary;
uu Checking the status of individual project risks;
uu Maintaining an accurate, timely information base concerning the project’s product(s) and their associated
documentation through project completion;
uu Providing information to support status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting;
uu Providing forecasts to update current cost and current schedule information;
uu Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur;
uu Providing appropriate reporting on project progress and status to program management when the project is part
of an overall program; and
uu Ensuring that the project stays aligned with the business needs.
4.5.1 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: INPUTS
4.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Monitoring and controlling project work involves looking at all aspects of the project.
Any component of the project management plan may be an input for this process.

4.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log contains information about assumptions and
constraints identified as affecting the project.
uu Basis of estimates. Described in Sections 6.4.3.2 and 7.2.3.2. Basis of estimates indicates how the various
estimates were derived and can be used to make a decision on how to respond to variances.
uu Cost forecasts. Described in Section 7.4.3.2. Based on the project’s past performance, the cost forecasts are
used to determine if the project is within defined tolerance ranges for budget and to identify any necessary
change requests.
uu Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log is used to document and monitor who is responsible for
resolving specific issues by a target date.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register may have information on
effective responses for variances, and corrective and preventive actions.
uu Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list shows the scheduled dates for specific milestones
and is used to check if the planned milestones have been met.
uu Quality reports. Described in Section 8.2.3.1. The quality report includes quality management issues;
recommendations for process, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations
(includes rework, defect/bugs repair, 100% inspection, and more); and the summary of findings from the
Control Quality process.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides information on threats and opportunities
that have occurred during project execution.
uu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report provides information on the overall project risks as
well as information on specified individual risks.
uu Schedule forecasts. Described in Section 6.6.3.2. Based on the project’s past performance, the schedule
forecasts are used to determine if the project is within defined tolerance ranges for schedule and to identify any
necessary change requests.


4.5.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
Work performance data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes. To become work
performance information, the work performance data are compared with the project management plan components,
project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.
Specific work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are defined at the start of the project
as part of the project management plan. Performance data are collected during the project through the controlling
processes and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance.
For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, to be useful, that
data has to be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources used to accomplish the work, and
the funding schedule. This additional information provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there
is a variance. It also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in
the project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance
data and the additional information as a whole provides a context that provides a sound foundation for project decisions.


4.5.1.4 AGREEMENTS
Described in Section 12.2.3.2. A procurement agreement includes terms and conditions, and may incorporate other
items that the buyer specifies regarding what the seller is to perform or provide. If the project is outsourcing part of the
work, the project manager needs to oversee the contractor’s work to make certain that all the agreements meet the
specific needs of the project while adhering to organizational procurement policies.
4.5.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include but are
not limited to:
uu Project management information systems such as scheduling, cost, resourcing tools, performance indicators,
databases, project records, and financials;
uu Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and equipment, organization´s telecommunications channels);
uu Stakeholders’ expectations and risk thresholds; and
uu Government or industry standards (e.g., regulatory agency regulations, product standards, quality standards, and
workmanship standards).

4.5.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include but are
not limited to:
uu Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;
uu Financial controls procedures (e.g., required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting codes, and
standard contract provisions);
uu Monitoring and reporting methods;
uu Issue management procedures defining issue controls, issue identification, and resolution and action item tracking;
uu Defect management procedures defining defect controls, defect identification, and resolution and action item
tracking; and
uu Organizational knowledge base, in particular process measurement and the lessons learned repository.
4.5.2 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
uu Earned value analysis,
uu Interpretation and contextualization of data,
uu Techniques to estimate duration and costs,
uu Trend analysis,
uu Technical knowledge on the industry and focus area of the project,
uu Risk management, and
uu Contract management.

4.5.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis techniques that can be used include but are not limited to:
uu Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to select the corrective actions or a combination of corrective
and preventive actions to implement when a deviation occurs.
uu Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. Cost-benefit analysis helps to determine the best corrective
action in terms of cost in case of project deviations.
uu Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Earned value provides an integrated perspective on scope,
schedule, and cost performance.
uu Root cause analysis. Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis focuses on identifying the main reasons
of a problem. It can be used to identify the reasons for a deviation and the areas the project manager should focus
on in order to achieve the objectives of the project.
uu Trend analysis. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the
project for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in
the schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline
to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to
recommend preventive actions if necessary.
uu Variance analysis. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual
performance. This can include duration estimates, cost estimates, resources utilization, resources rates, technical
performance, and other metrics.
Variance analysis may be conducted in each Knowledge Area based on its particular variables. In Monitor and
Control Project Work, the variance analysis reviews the variances from an integrated perspective considering
cost, time, technical, and resource variances in relation to each other to get an overall view of variance on the
project. This allows for the appropriate preventive or corrective actions to be initiated.


4.5.2.3 DECISION MAKING
A decision-making technique that can be used includes but is not limited to voting. Described in Section 5.2.2.4.
Voting can include making decisions based on unanimity, majority, or plurality.
4.5.2.4 MEETINGS
Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. They may include project team members and other project
stakeholders when appropriate. Types of meetings include but are not limited to user groups and review meetings.


4.5.3 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: OUTPUTS
4.5.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS
Work performance information is combined, recorded, and distributed in a physical or electronic form in order to create
awareness and generate decisions or actions. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of
work performance information intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. They are circulated to the project
stakeholders through the communication processes as defined in the project communications management plan.
Examples of work performance reports include status reports and progress reports. Work performance reports can
contain earned value graphs and information, trend lines and forecasts, reserve burndown charts, defect histograms,
contract performance information, and risk summaries. They can be presented as dashboards, heat reports, stop light
charts, or other representations useful for creating awareness and generating decisions and actions.
4.5.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.3.3.4. As a result of comparing planned results to actual results, change requests may
be issued to expand, adjust, or reduce project scope, product scope, or quality requirements and schedule or cost
baselines. Change requests may necessitate the collection and documentation of new requirements. Changes can
impact the project management plan, project documents, or product deliverables. Change requests are processed for
review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Changes may include but
are not limited to:
uu Corrective action. An intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project
management plan.
uu Preventive action. An intentional activity that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with
the project management plan.
uu Defect repair. An intentional activity that modifies a nonconforming product or product component.


4.5.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Changes identified during the Monitor and Control Project Work process may affect the overall project
management plan.


4.5.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Cost forecasts. Described in Section 7.4.3.2. Changes in cost forecasts resulting from this process are recorded
using cost management processes.
uu Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the
issue log.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with effective
responses for variances and corrective and preventive actions.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
register and managed using the risk management processes.
uu Schedule forecasts. Described in Section 6.6.3.2. Changes in schedule forecasts resulting from this process are
recorded using schedule management processes.


4.6 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL
Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and managing
changes to deliverables, project documents, and the project management plan; and communicating the decisions.
This process reviews all requests for changes to project documents, deliverables, or the project management plan
and determines the resolution of the change requests. The key benefit of this process is that it allows for documented
changes within the project to be considered in an integrated manner while addressing overall project risk, which often
arises from changes made without consideration of the overall project objectives or plans. This process is performed
throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-12. Figure
4-13 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

!!!!!!!!!! Figure 4-13. Perform Integrated Change Control: Data Flow Diagram

The Perform Integrated Change Control process is conducted from project start through completion and is the
ultimate responsibility of the project manager. Change requests can impact the project scope and the product scope,
as well as any project management plan component or any project document. Changes may be requested by any
stakeholder involved with the project and may occur at any time throughout the project life cycle. The applied level
of change control is dependent upon the application area, complexity of the specific project, contract requirements,
and the context and environment in which the project is performed.
Before the baselines are established, changes are not required to be formally controlled by the Perform Integrated
Change Control process. Once the project is baselined, change requests go through this process. As a general rule, each
project’s configuration management plan should define which project artifacts need to be placed under configuration
control. Any change in a configuration element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.
Although changes may be initiated verbally, they should be recorded in written form and entered into the change
management and/or configuration management system. Change requests may require information on estimated
schedule impacts and estimated cost impacts prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the
project baselines, a formal integrated change control process is always required. Every documented change request
needs to be either approved, deferred, or rejected by a responsible individual, usually the project sponsor or project
manager. The responsible individual will be identified in the project management plan or by organizational procedures.
When required, the Perform Integrated Change Control process includes a change control board (CCB), which is a
formally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the project
and for recording and communicating such decisions.
Approved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource
requirements, and/or analysis of risk response alternatives. These changes can require adjustments to the project
management plan and other project documents. Customer or sponsor approval may be required for certain change
requests after CCB approval, unless they are part of the CCB.


4.6.1 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: INPUTS
4.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Change management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The change management plan provides the direction
for managing the change control process and documents the roles and responsibilities of the change control
board (CCB).
uu Configuration management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The configuration management plan describes
the configurable items of the project and identifies the items that will be recorded and updated so that the
product of the project remains consistent and operable.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline provides the project and product definition.
uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is used to assess the impact of the
changes in the project schedule.
uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is used to assess the impact of the changes to
the project cost.
4.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Basis of estimates indicate how the duration, cost, and
resources estimates were derived and can be used to calculate the impact of the change in time, budget, and
resources.
uu Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix helps
assess the impact of the change on the project scope.
uu Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report presents information on sources of overall and
individual project risks involved by the change requested.


4.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS
Described in Section 4.5.3.1. Work performance reports of particular interest to the Perform Integrated Change Control
process include resource availability, schedule and cost data, earned value reports, and burnup or burndown charts.


4.6.1.4 CHANGE REQUESTS
Many processes produce change requests as an output. Change requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) may
include corrective action, preventive action, defect repairs, as well as updates to formally controlled documents or
deliverables to reflect modified or additional ideas or content. Changes may or may not impact the project baselines—
sometimes only the performance against the baseline is affected. Decisions on those changes are usually made by
the project manager.
Change requests that have an impact on the project baselines should normally include information about the cost
of implementing the change, modifications in the scheduled dates, resource requirements, and risks. These changes
should be approved by the CCB (if it exists) and by the customer or sponsor, unless they are part of the CCB. Only
approved changes should be incorporated into a revised baseline.
4.6.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Perform Integrated Change Control process include but
are not limited to:
uu Legal restrictions, such as country or local regulations;
uu Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship
standards);
uu Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints;
uu Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through
people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals); and
uu Contracting and purchasing constraints.

4.6.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Perform Integrated Change Control process include but are
not limited to:

any project documents will be modified, and how any changes will be approved and validated;
uu Procedures for approving and issuing change authorizations; and
uu Configuration management knowledge base containing the versions and baselines of all official organizational
standards, policies, procedures, and any project documents.

4.6.2 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
4.6.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
of or training in the following topics:
uu Technical knowledge of the industry and focus area of the project,
uu Legislation and regulations,
uu Legal and procurement,
uu Configuration management, and
uu Risk management.
4.6.2.2 CHANGE CONTROL TOOLS
In order to facilitate configuration and change management, manual or automated tools may be used. Configuration
control is focused on the specification of both the deliverables and the processes, while change control is focused on
identifying, documenting, and approving or rejecting changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.
Tool selection should be based on the needs of the project stakeholders including organizational and environmental
considerations and/or constraints. Tools should support the following configuration management activities:
uu Identify configuration item. Identification and selection of a configuration item to provide the basis for which
the product configuration is defined and verified, products and documents are labeled, changes are managed,
and accountability is maintained.
uu Record and report configuration item status. Information recording and reporting about each configuration item.
uu Perform configuration item verification and audit. Configuration verification and configuration audits ensure
that the composition of a project’s configuration items is correct and that corresponding changes are registered,
assessed, approved, tracked, and correctly implemented. This ensures that the functional requirements defined
in the configuration documentation are met.

 Tools should support the following change management activities as well:
uu Identify changes. Identifying and selecting a change item for processes or project documents.
uu Document changes. Documenting the change into a proper change request.
uu Decide on changes. Reviewing the changes; approving, rejecting, deferring, or making any other decision about
changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.
uu Track changes. Verifying that the changes are registered, assessed, approved, and tracked and communicating
final results to stakeholders.
Tools are also used to manage the change requests and the resulting decisions. Additional considerations should be
made for communications to assist the change control board (CCB) members in their duties, as well as to distribute the
decisions to the appropriate stakeholders.


4.6.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to assess the requested changes and
decide which are accepted, rejected, or need to be modified to be finally accepted.
uu Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. This analysis helps to determine if the requested change is
worth its associated cost.


4.6.2.4 DECISION MAKING
Decision-making techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Voting. Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Voting can take the form of unanimity, majority, or plurality to decide on
whether to accept, defer, or reject change requests.
uu Autocratic decision making. In this decision-making technique, one individual takes the responsibility for
making the decision for the entire group.
uu Multicriteria decision analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. This technique uses a decision matrix to provide
a systematic analytical approach to evaluate the requested changes according to a set of predefined criteria.

4.6.2.5 MEETINGS
Change control meetings are held with a change control board (CCB) that is responsible for meeting and reviewing
the change requests and approving, rejecting, or deferring change requests. Most changes will have some sort of impact
on time, cost, resources, or risks. Assessing the impact of the changes is an essential part of the meeting. Alternatives
to the requested changes may also be discussed and proposed. Finally, the decision is communicated to the request
owner or group.
The CCB may also review configuration management activities. The roles and responsibilities of these boards are
clearly defined and agreed upon by the appropriate stakeholders and are documented in the change management plan.
CCB decisions are documented and communicated to the stakeholders for information and follow-up actions.
4.6.3 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: OUTPUTS
4.6.3.1 APPROVED CHANGE REQUESTS
Change requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) are processed according to the change management plan by the
project manager, CCB, or an assigned team member. As a result, changes may be approved, deferred, or rejected.
Approved change requests will be implemented through the Direct and Manage Project Work process. Deferred or
rejected change requests are communicated to the person or group requesting the change.
The disposition of all change requests are recorded in the change log as a project document update.
4.6.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any formally controlled component of the project management plan may be changed as a result of this process.
Changes to baselines are only made from the last baseline forward. Past performance is not changed. This protects the
integrity of the baselines and the historical data of past performance.


4.6.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Any formally controlled project document may be changed as a result of this process. A project document that is
normally updated as a result of this process is the change log. The change log is used to document changes that occur
during a project.

4.7 CLOSE PROJECT OR PHASE
Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. The key benefits of
this process are the project or phase information is archived, the planned work is completed, and organizational team
resources are released to pursue new endeavors. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.
The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-14. Figure 4-15 depicts the data
flow diagram for the process.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Figure 4-14. Close Project or Phase: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!!!!!!!! Figure 4-15. Close Project or Phase: Data Flow Diagram

the lessons learned repository for use by future projects.


PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT
Project Scope Management includes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required,
and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. Managing the project scope is primarily concerned with
defining and controlling what is and is not included in the project.
The Project Scope Management processes are:
5.1 Plan Scope Management—The process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project
and product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
5.2 Collect Requirements—The process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and
requirements to meet project objectives.
5.3 Define Scope—The process of developing a detailed description of the project and product.
5.4 Create WBS—The process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable
components.
5.5 Validate Scope—The process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
5.6 Control Scope—The process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes
to the scope baseline.
Figure 5-1 provides an overview of the Project Scope Management processes. The Project Scope Management
processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in
ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.


!!!!!!!!! Figure 5-1. Project Scope Management Overview

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT
In the project context, the term “scope” can refer to:
uu Product scope. The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.
uu Project scope. The work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and
functions. The term “project scope” is sometimes viewed as including product scope.
Project life cycles can range along a continuum from predictive approaches at one end to adaptive or agile approaches
at the other. In a predictive life cycle, the project deliverables are defined at the beginning of the project and any changes
to the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple
iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved for each iteration when it begins.
Projects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require ongoing stakeholder
engagement. The overall scope of an adaptive project will be decomposed into a set of requirements and work to
be performed, sometimes referred to as a product backlog. At the beginning of an iteration, the team will work to
determine how many of the highest-priority items on the backlog list can be delivered within the next iteration. Three
processes (Collect Requirements, Define Scope, and Create WBS) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a
predictive project, these processes are performed toward the beginning of the project and updated as necessary, using
the integrated change control process.
In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the sponsor and customer representatives should be continuously engaged with the
project to provide feedback on deliverables as they are created and to ensure that the product backlog reflects their
current needs. Two processes (Validate Scope and Control Scope) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a
predictive project, Validate Scope occurs with each deliverable or phase review and Control Scope is an ongoing process.
In predictive projects, the scope baseline for the project is the approved version of the project scope statement, work
breakdown structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary. A baseline can be changed only through formal change
control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison while performing Validate Scope and Control Scope processes
as well as other controlling processes. Projects with adaptive life cycles use backlogs (including product requirements
and user stories) to reflect their current needs.

Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan, while completion of the product
scope is measured against the product requirements. The term “requirement” is defined as a condition or capability that
is required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification.
Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The verified deliverables
obtained from the Control Quality process are an input to the Validate Scope process. One of the outputs of Validate
Scope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the
stakeholder needs to get involved early on during planning (sometimes initiating as well) and to provide inputs about
quality of deliverables so that Control Quality can assess the performance and recommend necessary changes.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT
Requirements have always been a concern in project management and have continued to gain more attention in
the profession. As the global environment becomes more complex, organizations are starting to recognize how to
use business analysis to their competitive advantage by defining, managing, and controlling requirements activities.
Activities of business analysis may start before a project is initiated and a project manager is assigned. According
to Requirements Management: A Practice Guide [14], the requirements management process starts with a needs
assessment, which may begin in portfolio planning, in program planning, or within a discrete project.
Eliciting, documenting, and managing stakeholder requirements takes place within the Project Scope Management
processes. Trends and emerging practices for Project Scope Management include but are not limited to a focus on
collaborating with business analysis professionals to:
uu Determine problems and identify business needs;
uu Identify and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs;
uu Elicit, document, and manage stakeholder requirements in order to meet business and project objectives; and
uu Facilitate the successful implementation of the product, service, or end result of the program or project [7].
The process ends with the requirements closure, which transitions the product, service, or result to the recipient in
order to measure, monitor, realize, and sustain benefits over time.
The role with responsibility to conduct business analysis should be assigned to resources with sufficient business
analysis skills and expertise. If a business analyst is assigned to a project, requirement-related activities are the
responsibility of that role. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that requirements-related work is accounted
for in the project management plan and that requirements-related activities are performed on time and within budget
and deliver value.
The relationship between a project manager and a business analyst should be a collaborative partnership. A project
will have a higher likelihood of being successful if project managers and business analysts fully understand each other’s
roles and responsibilities to successfully achieve project objectives.


TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS
Because each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Scope Management processes
are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
uu Knowledge and requirements management. Does the organization have formal or informal knowledge and
requirements management systems? What guidelines should the project manager establish for requirements to
be reused in the future?
uu Validation and control. Does the organization have existing formal or informal validation and control-related
policies, procedures, and guidelines?
uu Development approach. Does the organization use agile approaches in managing projects? Is the development
approach iterative or incremental? Is a predictive approach used? Will a hybrid approach be productive?
uu Stability of requirements. Are there areas of the project with unstable requirements? Do unstable requirements
necessitate the use of lean, agile, or other adaptive techniques until they are stable and well defined?
uu Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures,
and guidelines?
CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or significant uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the
beginning of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods deliberately spend less time trying to define
and agree on scope in the early stage of the project and spend more time establishing the process for its ongoing
discovery and refinement. Many environments with emerging requirements find that there is often a gap between
the real business requirements and the business requirements that were originally stated. Therefore, agile methods
purposefully build and review prototypes and release versions in order to refine the requirements. As a result, scope is
defined and redefined throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements constitute the backlog.


5.1 PLAN SCOPE MANAGEMENT
Plan Scope Management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and
product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and
direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points
in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-2. Figure 5-3 depicts
the data flow diagram of the process.


!!!!!!!!! Figure 5-3. Plan Scope Management: Data Flow Diagram

The scope management plan is a component of the project or program management plan that describes how the
scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. The development of the scope management plan
and the detailing of the project scope begin with the analysis of information contained in the project charter (Section
4.1.3.1), the latest approved subsidiary plans of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1), historical information
contained in the organizational process assets (Section 2.3), and any other relevant enterprise environmental factors
(Section 2.2).

of the project.
5.1.3.2 REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT PLAN
The requirements management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project and
product requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed. According to Business Analysis for Practitioners:
A Practice Guide [7], some organizations refer to it as a business analysis plan. Components of the requirements
management plan can include but are not limited to:
uu How requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported;
uu Configuration management activities such as: how changes will be initiated; how impacts will be analyzed; how
they will be traced, tracked, and reported; as well as the authorization levels required to approve these changes;
uu Requirements prioritization process;
uu Metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and
uu Traceability structure that reflects the requirement attributes captured on the traceability matrix.


5.2 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS
Collect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements
to meet objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the basis for defining the product scope and project
scope. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and
outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-4. Figure 5-5 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

The PMBOK® Guide does not specifically address product requirements since those are industry specific. Note that
Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7] provides more in-depth information about product requirements.
The project’s success is directly influenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of
needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the
requirements of the product, service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are
required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification.
Requirements include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other
stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the
scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins. Requirements become the foundation of the WBS.
Cost, schedule, quality planning, and procurement are all based on these requirements.


5.2.1.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Assumption Log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log identified assumptions about the product,
project, environment, stakeholders, and other factors that can influence requirements.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is used to provide
information on effective requirements collection techniques, especially for projects that are using an iterative or
adaptive product development methodology.
uu Stakeholder Register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register is used to identify stakeholders
who can provide information on the requirements. It also captures requirements and expectations that
stakeholders have for the project.
5.2.1.4 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
Described in Section 1.2.6. A business document that can influence the Collect Requirements process is the
business case, which can describe required, desired, and optional criteria for meeting the business needs.
5.2.1.5 AGREEMENTS
Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements can contain project and product requirements.
5.2.1.6 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to:
uu Organization’s culture,
uu Infrastructure,
uu Personnel administration, and
uu Marketplace conditions.


5.2.1.7 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to:
uu Policies and procedures, and
uu Historical information and lessons learned repository with information from previous projects.


5.2.2 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
5.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
uu Business analysis,
uu Requirements elicitation,
uu Requirements analysis,
uu Requirements documentation,
uu Project requirements in previous similar projects,
uu Diagramming techniques,
uu Facilitation, and
uu Conflict management.

5.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING
Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple
ideas related to project and product requirements.
uu Interviews. An interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking
to them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the
responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but
may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants,
sponsors, other executives, and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and defining the features and
functions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining confidential information.
uu Focus groups. Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about
their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the
group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview.


uu Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly
accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate
with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and
where statistical analysis could be appropriate.
uu Benchmarking. Described in Section 8.1.2.2. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products,
processes, and practices to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for
improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking
can be internal or external.

5.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS
Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited
to document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information.
In this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying
information relevant to the requirements. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant
requirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to:
uu Agreements;
uu Business plans;
uu Business process or interface documentation;
uu Business rules repositories;
uu Current process flows;
uu Marketing literature;
uu Problem/issue logs;
uu Policies and procedures;
uu Regulatory documentation such as laws, codes, or ordinances, etc.;
uu Requests for proposal; and
uu Use cases.

5.2.2.4 DECISION MAKING
Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to:
uu Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives
with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and
prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include:
un Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action.
un Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group.
Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather
than resulting in a tie.
un Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not
achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.
uu Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision
for the group.
uu Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical
approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.
5.2.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION
Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Affinity diagrams. Affinity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classified into groups for review and
analysis.
uu Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a
single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas.


5.2.2.6 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS
Described in Section 4.1.2.3. The interpersonal and team skills that can be used in this process include but are not
limited to:
uu Nominal group technique. The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used
to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group technique is a
structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps:

un A question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas.
un The moderator writes down the ideas on a flip chart until all ideas are recorded.
un Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.
un Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5
being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round,
the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected.
uu Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their
environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed
processes when the people who use the product have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements.
Observation is also known as “job shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business
expert performing a job. It can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or
procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.
uu Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders
together to define product requirements. Workshops can be used to quickly define cross-functional
requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated
sessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can
lead to increased stakeholder consensus. In addition, issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more
quickly than in individual sessions.
Facilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to:
un Joint application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry.
These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team
together to gather requirements and improve the software development process.
un Quality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that
helps determine critical characteristics for new product development. QFD starts by collecting customer
needs, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized,
and goals are set for achieving them.
un User stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed
during a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who benefits from the feature
(role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the benefit to the stakeholder (motivation).


5.2.2.7 CONTEXT DIAGRAM
The context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing
a business system (process, equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems (actors) interact
with it (see Figure 5-6). Context diagrams show inputs to the business system, the actor(s) providing the input, the
outputs from the business system, and the actor(s) receiving the output.

5.2.2.8 PROTOTYPES
Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product
before actually building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models,
mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than
being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive
elaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision.
When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently
complete to move to a design or build phase.
Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations.
Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as film, advertising, instructional design,
and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards use mock-ups to show
navigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces.
5.2.3 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: OUTPUTS
5.2.3.1 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION
Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project.
Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the
requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable),
traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may
range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate
forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.


Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the
former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can
be grouped into classifications allowing for further refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These
classifications include:
uu Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the
business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.
uu Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.
uu Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or
result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into
functional and nonfunctional requirements:
un Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include
actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.
un Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe
the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability,
security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.
uu Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and
training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state.
uu Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet.
Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.
uu Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion
of a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certifications,
validations, etc.

5.2.3.2 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX
The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables
that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds
business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout
the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at
the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.

Tracing requirements includes but is not limited to:
uu Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;
uu Project objectives;
uu Project scope and WBS deliverables;
uu Product design;
uu Product development;
uu Test strategy and test scenarios; and
uu High-level requirements to more detailed requirements.
Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix. These
attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability
matrix may include: a unique identifier, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner,
source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed),
and status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include
stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 5-7 provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix
with its associated attributes.


5.3 DEFINE SCOPE
Define Scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product. The key benefit of
this process is that it describes the product, service, or result boundaries and acceptance criteria. The inputs, tools
and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-8. Figure 5-9 depicts the data flow diagram
of the process.


!!!!!!!!! Figure 5-8. Define Scope: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

Figure 5-9. Define Scope: Data Flow Diagram
Since all the requirements identified in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project, the Define Scope
process selects the final project requirements from the requirements documentation developed during the Collect
Requirements process. It then develops a detailed description of the project and product, service, or result.
The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the major deliverables, assumptions, and
constraints that are documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope is defined and
described with greater specificity as more information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and
constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Define Scope process can be highly
iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope
is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses
on the current project scope and deliverables.

5.3.1 DEFINE SCOPE: INPUTS
5.3.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER
Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description, product characteristics,
and approval requirements.
5.3.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. A project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope
management plan as described in Section 5.1.3.1, which documents how the project scope will be defined, validated,
and controlled.
5.3.1.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log identifies assumptions and constraints about
the product, project, environment, stakeholders, and other factors that can influence the project and product scope.
uu Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation identifies
requirements that will be incorporated into the scope.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains response strategies that may affect the
project scope, such as reducing or changing project and product scope to avoid or mitigate a risk.

5.3.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Define Scope process include but are not limited to:
uu Organization’s culture,
uu Infrastructure,
uu Personnel administration, and
uu Marketplace conditions.
5.3.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Define Scope process include but are not limited to:
uu Policies, procedures, and templates for a project scope statement;
uu Project files from previous projects; and
uu Lessons learned from previous phases or projects.

5.3.2 DEFINE SCOPE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
5.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or
experience with similar projects.
5.3.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS
An example of a data analysis technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives
analysis. Alternatives analysis can be used to evaluate ways to meet the requirements and the objectives identified in
the charter.
5.3.2.3 DECISION MAKING
Described in Section 5.1.2.2. A decision-making technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited
to multicriteria decision analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4, multicriteria decision analysis is a technique that uses
a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as requirements, schedule,
budget, and resources, in order to refine the project and product scope for the project.
5.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS
Described in Section 4.1.2.3. An example of an interpersonal and team skills technique is facilitation. Facilitation
is used in workshops and working sessions with key stakeholders who have a variety of expectations or fields of
expertise. The goal is to reach a cross-functional and common understanding of the project deliverables and project
and product boundaries.

5.3.2.5 PRODUCT ANALYSIS
Product analysis can be used to define products and services. It includes asking questions about a product or service
and forming answers to describe the use, characteristics, and other relevant aspects of what is going to be delivered.
Each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating high-level product or service
descriptions into meaningful deliverables. Requirements are captured at a high level and decomposed to the level of
detail needed to design the final product. Examples of product analysis techniques include but are not limited to:
uu Product breakdown,
uu Requirements analysis,
uu Systems analysis,
uu Systems engineering,
uu Value analysis, and
uu Value engineering.


5.3.3 DEFINE SCOPE: OUTPUTS
5.3.3.1 PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT
The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.
The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s
deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may
contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team
to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team’s work during execution, and provides the baseline for
evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries.
The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement defines the work that will be performed and the
work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope.
The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following:
uu Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result
described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
uu Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required
to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as
project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level
or in great detail.
uu Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
uu Project exclusions. Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the
project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep.
Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain
degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project charter contains highlevel information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed description of the scope components. These
components are progressively elaborated throughout the project. Table 5-1 describes some of the key elements for
each document.


!!!!!!!!! Table 5-1. Elements of the Project Charter and Project Scope Statement


5.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with additional assumptions or
constraints that were identified during this process.
uu Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated
with additional or changed requirements.
uu Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix may be
updated to reflect updates in requirement documentation.
uu Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. Where additional information on existing or new
stakeholders is gathered as a result of this process, it is recorded in the stakeholder register.


5.4 CREATE WBS
Create WBS is the process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable
components. The key benefit of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are
depicted in Figure 5-10. Figure 5-11 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.


Figure 5-10. Create WBS: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

Figure 5-11. Create WBS: Data Flow Diagram


The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish
the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of the project
and represents the work specified in the current approved project scope statement.
The planned work is contained within the lowest level of WBS components, which are called work packages. A work
package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, monitored, and controlled. In the
context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself.
5.4.1 CREATE WBS: INPUTS
5.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
A project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope management plan. Described in
Section 5.1.3.1, the scope management plan documents how the WBS will be created from the project scope statement.
5.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Project scope statement. Described in Section 5.3.3.1. The project scope statement describes the work that
will be performed and the work that is excluded.
uu Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Detailed requirements describe how individual
requirements meet the business need for the project.
5.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Create WBS process include but are not limited to
industry-specific WBS standards that are relevant to the nature of the project. These industry-specific standards may
serve as external reference sources for creating the WBS.
5.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Create WBS process include but are not limited to:
uu Policies, procedures, and templates for the WBS;
uu Project files from previous projects; and
uu Lessons learned from previous projects.

5.4.2 CREATE WBS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
5.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or
experience with similar projects.
5.4.2.2 DECOMPOSITION
Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into
smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the WBS for which cost and
duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to
effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project.
Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities:
uu Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work,
uu Structuring and organizing the WBS,
uu Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components,
uu Developing and assigning identification codes to the WBS components, and
uu Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate.
A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package level is shown in
Figure 5-12.

Figure 5-12. Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages

A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the top-down
approach, the use of organization-specific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. A bottom-up approach can be used
to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented in a number of forms, such as:
uu Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product and project
deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 5-13;
uu Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 5-14; and
uu Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as
contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as part of the contracted work.

Decomposition of the upper-level WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or
subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS components represent verifiable products, services,
or results. If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an
outline, an organizational chart, or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the
decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are necessary and sufficient for
completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition.
To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need
additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and
control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefficient
use of resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.
Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future.
The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the
WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.

The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at
the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is
sometimes called the 100 percent rule.
For specific information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures – Second
Edition [15]. This standard contains industry-specific examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to specific projects
in a particular application area.
5.4.3 CREATE WBS: OUTPUTS
5.4.3.1 SCOPE BASELINE
The scope baseline is the approved version of a scope statement, WBS, and its associated WBS dictionary, which can
be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison. It is a component of
the project management plan. Components of the scope baseline include:
uu Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the project scope, major
deliverables, assumptions, and constraints (Section 5.3.3.1).
uu WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team
to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS
represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.
uu Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identifier. These identifiers provide
a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, and resource information and form a code of accounts.
Each work package is part of a control account. A control account is a management control point where scope,
budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance measurement. A control
account has two or more work packages, though each work package is associated with a single control account.
uu Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. A planning package is a
work breakdown structure component below the control account and above the work package with known work
content but without detailed schedule activities.


uu WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling
information about each component in the WBS. The WBS dictionary is a document that supports the WBS. Most
of the information included in the WBS dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a
later stage. Information in the WBS dictionary may include but is not limited to:
un Code of account identifier,
un Description of work,
un Assumptions and constraints,
un Responsible organization,
un Schedule milestones,
un Associated schedule activities,
un Resources required,
un Cost estimates,
un Quality requirements,
un Acceptance criteria,
un Technical references, and
un Agreement information.
5.4.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
un Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with additional assumptions
or constraints that were identified during the Create WBS process.
un Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated
to include approved changes resulting from the Create WBS process.


5.5 VALIDATE SCOPE
Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The key benefit of this
process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of final product, service,
or result acceptance by validating each deliverable. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as
needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-15. Figure 5-16 depicts
the data flow diagram of the process.

!!!!!!!!!!!! Figure 5-16. Validate Scope: Data Flow Diagram
The verified deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the customer or sponsor to
ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or
sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the Planning processes in the Project Scope Management
Knowledge Area, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well as the work performance data
obtained from the Execution processes in other Knowledge Areas, are the basis for performing the validation and for
final acceptance.
The Validate Scope process differs from the Control Quality process in that the former is primarily concerned with
acceptance of the deliverables, while the latter is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting
the quality requirements specified for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before Validate Scope,
although the two processes may be performed in parallel.

5.5.1 VALIDATE SCOPE: INPUTS
5.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The project management plan specifies how formal
acceptance of the completed project deliverables will be obtained.
uu Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes
how the project requirements are validated.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline is compared to actual results to determine if
a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.

with the results of the validation, including the method used and the outcome.
5.6 CONTROL SCOPE
Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to
the scope baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the scope baseline is maintained throughout the project. This
process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted
in Figure 5-17. Figure 5-18 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.


!!!!! Figure 5-17. Control Scope: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!!!! Figure 5-18. Control Scope: Data Flow Diagram
Controlling the project scope ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions
are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (see Section 4.6). Control Scope is also used
to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled
expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as scope creep.
Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.

future scope performance.
5.6.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the scope and
schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review
and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).

PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
Project Schedule Management includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.
The Project Schedule Management processes are:
6.1 Plan Schedule Management—The process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for
planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule.
6.2 Define Activities—The process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce
the project deliverables.
6.3 Sequence Activities—The process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.
6.4 Estimate Activity Durations—The process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete
individual activities with the estimated resources.
6.5 Develop Schedule—The process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and
schedule constraints to create the project schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling.
6.6 Control Schedule—The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and
manage changes to the schedule baseline.
Figure 6-1 provides an overview of the Project Schedule Management processes. The Project Schedule Management
processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in
ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.


!!!!!!!!!!! Figure 6-1. Project Schedule Management Overview

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
Project scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products,
services, and results defined in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication, managing stakeholders’
expectations, and as a basis for performance reporting.
The project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the
project-specific data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are
entered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 6-2
provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project
Schedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.
For smaller projects, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, and developing the
schedule model are so tightly linked that they are viewed as a single process that can be performed by a person
over a relatively short period of time. These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and
techniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard
for Scheduling [2].
When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge
gained, increased understanding of the risk, and value-added activities.


TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where
long term scope is difficult to define, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective
adoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. Adaptive
planning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to
reflect this new knowledge.
Some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:
uu Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles,
such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are
then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed
periods of work. This approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple
teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This
scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive
life cycles for product development. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the
development life cycle.
uu On-demand scheduling. This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theory-ofconstraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress
in order to balance demand against the team’s delivery throughput. On-demand scheduling does not rely
on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments,
but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources
become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in
operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope
or can be bundled by size and scope.


TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS
Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Schedule Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
uu Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?
uu Resource availability. What are the factors influencing durations (such as the correlation between available
resources and their productivity)?
uu Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty,
pace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators)
impact the desired level of control?
uu Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model
information and is it readily accessible?
For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].
CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
Adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review the results, and adapt as necessary. These
cycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative
scheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices
in Project Schedule Management.
 In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps
to manage the development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team size, geographical distribution,
regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for
larger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid
of both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or
adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.
The role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life
cycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the
project manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively.


6.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
Plan Schedule Management is the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for
planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. The key benefit of this process is
that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project. This
process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
process are depicted in Figure 6-3. Figure 6-4 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

6.1.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: INPUTS
6.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER
Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence the
management of the project schedule.
6.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope
will be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed.
uu Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define the
scheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule.
6.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not
limited to:
uu Organizational culture and structure,
uu Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability,
uu Scheduling software,
uu Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the
specific needs of the project, and
uu Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data.

6.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not
limited to:
uu Historical information and lessons learned repositories;
uu Existing formal and informal schedule development, management- and control-related policies, procedures,
and guidelines;
uu Templates and forms; and
uu Monitoring and reporting tools.


6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in previous, similar projects:
uu Schedule development, management, and control;
uu Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle);
uu Scheduling software; and
uu The specific industry for which the project is developed.
6.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS
A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.
Alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine various
methods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of
waves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between
the level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be
reached for each project.
6.1.2.3 MEETINGS
Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetings
may include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone
with responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.


6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS
6.1.3.1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN
The schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria
and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be
formal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate
control thresholds.

The schedule management plan can establish the following:
uu Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the
development of the project schedule model are specified.
uu Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the time-boxed periods for releases, waves,
and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward
completion of a goal. Time-boxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential
features first, then other features when time permits.
uu Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity
duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.
uu Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, or
meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.
uu Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework
for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.
uu Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the
project in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.
uu Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an
agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically
expressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.
uu Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement
rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify:
un Rules for establishing percent complete,
un EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specific
information, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and
un Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)
used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.
uu Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.

6.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES
Define Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce
the project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities
that provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process
is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in
Figure 6-5. Figure 6-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

!!!!!!!! Figure 6-5. Define Activities: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!!!! Figure 6-6. Define Activities: Data Flow Diagram


6.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS
6.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the
schedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary to
manage the work.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities.
6.2.1.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Enterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:
uu Organizational cultures and structure,
uu Published commercial information from commercial databases, and
uu Project management information system (PMIS).
6.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:
uu Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects,
uu Standardized processes,
uu Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and
uu Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling
methodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.


6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
of similar past projects and the work being performed.

6.2.2.2 DECOMPOSITION
Described in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and
project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work
package. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the
Create WBS process (Section 5.4).
The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS
dictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed
into the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can
lead to better and more accurate results.
6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING
Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration
applicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.
Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early
strategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As
more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.
6.2.2.4 MEETINGS
Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subject
matter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.


6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS
6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST
The activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planning
or agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes
an activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project team
members understand what work is required to be completed.

6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES
Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each
activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include
the unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity
descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),
resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the
place where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort
involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned
schedule activities in various ways within reports
6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST
A milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates
whether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical
information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event.
6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into
activities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.
Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process
(Section 4.6).

6.2.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively
elaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,
necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the
schedule baseline.
uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
approved changes in schedule activities.


6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES
Sequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key
benefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project
constraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this
process are depicted in Figure 6-7. Figure 6-8 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.


!!!!!!!! Figure 6-8. Sequence Activities: Data Flow Diagram

Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor
activity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project
schedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project
schedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated
techniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to
act as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.
6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS

6.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method
used and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities.
6.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of
events or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships
between the activities.
uu Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project
that are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencing
of the activities.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
influence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,
and may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.
uu Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,
which may influence the way activities are sequenced.


6.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:
uu Government or industry standards,
uu Project management information system (PMIS),
uu Scheduling tools, and
uu Organization work authorization systems.
6.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:
uu Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships;
uu Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling
methodology that is considered in developing logical relationships;
uu Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes
information in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and
uu Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.
6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD
The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities
are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which
the activities are to be performed.
PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically
comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after
another activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:


uu Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity
has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware
is assembled (predecessor).
uu Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity
has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document
(successor) can finish.
uu Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity
has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.
uu Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity
has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts
payable system can be shut down (predecessor).
In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but
is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.
Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships
between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the
highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.

6.3.2.2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATION
Dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external
(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following
ways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or
discretionary internal dependencies.
uu Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or
inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a
construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,
or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies
are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.
The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.
Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.
uu Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,
preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best
practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence
is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best
practices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing
work. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing
the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully
documented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast
tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for
modification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process
of sequencing the activities.

uu External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the
testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or
governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction
project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of
sequencing the activities.
uu Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and
are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble
it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies
are internal during the process of sequencing the activities.

6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS
A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,
on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled
punch list completion. This would be shown as a finish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often
represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.

A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,
a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be
shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can also be represented in project
schedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the
nomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).
The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define the
logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include
any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.

!!!!!! Figure 6-11. Project Schedule Network Diagram

6.3.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)
Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the
capability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag
values; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.


6.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS
6.3.3.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS
A project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as
dependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 6-11 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A
project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full
project details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe
the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully
described within the narrative.
Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor
activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected
by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one
predecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.
6.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of
events or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships
between the activities.
uu Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships
among the project activities during the sequencing activities.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
need to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise
to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.
uu Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted by
changes in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.


6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS
Estimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual
activities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity
will take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of
this process are depicted in Figure 6-12. Figure 6-13 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

!!!!! Figure 6-12. Estimate Activity Durations: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

Figure 6-13. Estimate Activity Durations: Data Flow Diagram
Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,
estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include
constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed
number of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration
originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific
activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the
input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,
the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.


The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete
the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to
approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project
and resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an
activity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving
resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straight-line” or
linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,
or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation
(e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:
uu Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a
unit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions
of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.
uu Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does
not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding
too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional
coordination, and other factors involved.
uu Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an
increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,
which may impact duration and resource needs.
uu Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—
when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law
where work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.


6.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS
6.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method
used, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which contains
technical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates.
6.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor or
successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may
impact duration estimates.
uu Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the
project, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the
duration estimates.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to
effort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision
of effort and duration estimates.
uu Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones
that may impact the duration estimates.
uu Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people
have been assigned to the team.
uu Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a
hierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.

uu Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of schedule
activities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.
Resource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project.
uu Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have
an effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet
the requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lowerskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increased
communication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and
availability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section
11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses.
6.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not
limited to:
uu Duration estimating databases and other reference data,
uu Productivity metrics,
uu Published commercial information, and
uu Location of team members.

6.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not
limited to:
uu Historical duration information,
uu Project calendars,
uu Estimating policies,
uu Scheduling methodology, and
uu Lessons learned repository.

6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT
Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
uu Schedule development, management, and control;
uu Expertise in estimating; and
uu Discipline or application knowledge.
6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING
Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical
data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as
duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future
project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis
for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known
differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when
there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.
Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also
less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may
be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous
activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates
have the needed expertise.
6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING
Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based
on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,
budget, and duration.

Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor
hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by
the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor
hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to
install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).
This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into
the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction
with other estimating methods.
6.4.2.4 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING
The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.
Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration:
uu Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,
their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and
interruptions.
uu Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
uu Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,
can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:
tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.
Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration
estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of
uncertainty around the expected duration.

6.4.2.5 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING
Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lowerlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,
the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are
then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies
between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource
usage is reflected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.
6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;
scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);
and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and
duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.
uu Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve
needed for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule
reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule
baseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the
known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency
reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingency
reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the
project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be
clearly identified in the schedule documentation.
Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management
reserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are
reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address
the unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,
but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management
reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.


6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING
Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited
to voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the fist of five (also called
fist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding
up a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than
three fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager
continues the fist-of-five process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees
to move on to the next decision.
6.4.2.8 MEETINGS
The project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary
to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide
which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to
low-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity
over the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the product
owner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as
assumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.

6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS
6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES
Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete
an activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration
estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:
uu A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12
(assuming a 5-day work week); or
uu A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take
3 weeks or less.


6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES
The amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of
the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration
estimate was derived.
Supporting detail for duration estimates may include:
uu Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),
uu Documentation of all assumptions made,
uu Documentation of any known constraints,
uu Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., ±10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a
range of values),
uu Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and
uu Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate.
6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are
documented as part of the activity attributes.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration
estimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,
constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
techniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.

6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULE
Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule
constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this
process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process
is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in
Figure 6-14. Figure 6-15 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

!!!!!! Figure 6-14. Develop Schedule: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!! Figure 6-15. Develop Schedule: Data Flow Diagram

Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the
planned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule
development can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to
establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the
project milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish
dates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned
activities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assigned
activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with
logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising and
maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,
as described in Section 6.7.

6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSIS
Schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs
several other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques
(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but
is not limited to:
uu Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple
paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the
probability of a schedule slip.
uu Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate
use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.
Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.

6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD
The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule
flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates
the early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations
by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 6-16. In this
example, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of A-C-D is the critical path.
The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines
the shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting early
and late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within
which the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical
relationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)
and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.
On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule
activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a
schedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implemented
with the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float
depending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a
schedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.
Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative float
analysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.
Schedule networks may have multiple near-critical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define the
parameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less
scope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and
lags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.
Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule
activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For
example the free float for Activity B, in Figure 6-16, is 5 days.

6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION
Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be
equal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the
schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:
uu Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with
the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when
shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as
shown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often
cause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical
path through the project schedule may change.
uu Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for
resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to
resource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other
words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able to
optimize all resources.

6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict
their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation
represented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute
the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,
or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if
scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in
preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.
uu Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty
to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is
Monte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate
possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations
with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions
and other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 6-18 shows a probability distribution for a
project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a
10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability
of completing the project by May 28.


6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS
Described in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable
schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a
successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes
require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.

6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPRESSION
Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the
project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique
is the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed
date, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 6-19 and include:
uu Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.
Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery
to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources
will shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in
increased risk and/or cost.
uu Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence
are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a
building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased
risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical
path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities
concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.

6.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)
Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites
the process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, network
diagrams, resources, and activity durations.
6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING
Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)
based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning also
determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide
how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,
dependencies, and impediments.
Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule
as it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the
customer is looking for.

6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS
6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE
A schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change
control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate
stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and
controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances have
occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.
6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE
The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,
milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date
for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource
assignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no
later than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also
be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in
summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although
a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of
the following formats:
uu Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed
on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal
bars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.
Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the
broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent
work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21
that is presented in a WBS-structured format.

uu Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of
major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21.
uu Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node
diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure
logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that
is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with
activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule
activities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.
Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams
include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are
optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the
same line of the diagram in sequence.
Figure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported
through as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reflects schedule presentations in
the forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed
schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the
different levels of detail of the project schedule.

6.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATA
The schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the
schedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,
and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application
area. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:
uu Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;
uu Alternative schedules, such as best-case or worst-case, not resource-leveled or resource-leveled, or with or
without imposed dates; and
uu Applied schedule reserves.
Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cash-flow projections, order and delivery
schedules, or other relevant information.
6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARS
A project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes
time periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not
available for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for
some activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.
6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests
to the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for
review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may
include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.

6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to
reflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed.
uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a
revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.
6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource
requirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process.
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions
in duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the
schedule model.
uu Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the
activity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resource-leveling analysis changes
the resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
techniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.
uu Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect on
preliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resource-leveling analysis changes
the resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or
threats perceived through scheduling assumptions.


6.6 CONTROL SCHEDULE
Control Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing
changes to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout
the project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this
process are depicted in Figure 6-22. Figure 6-23 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

!!!!!!! Figure 6-22. Control Schedule: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs

!!!!!!!! Figure 6-23. Control Schedule: Data Flow Diagram

Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline
can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a
component of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with:
uu Determining the current status of the project schedule,
uu Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,
uu Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,
uu Determining if the project schedule has changed, and
uu Managing the actual changes as they occur.

When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:
uu Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and
accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;
uu Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,
if required;
uu Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);
uu Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time
per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month);
uu Determining that the project schedule has changed; and
uu Managing the actual changes as they occur.
When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of
ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and
walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.
6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS
6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency
that the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled.
uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to
determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.
uu Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule
baseline.
uu Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the
performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or
preventive action is necessary.


6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS
Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
later phases in the project to improve schedule control.
uu Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar
to allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.
uu Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations
to indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date.
uu Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and
physical resources.
uu Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control
Schedule process.
6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA
Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have
started, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities
have finished.
6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
The organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to:
uu Existing formal and informal schedule control-related policies, procedures, and guidelines;
uu Schedule control tools; and
uu Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.


6.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
uu Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule
variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original
schedule baseline.
uu Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It
is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration
planning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration
completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal
burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion
based on remaining work. Figure 6-24 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.

uu Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against
the schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work
in progress.
uu Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine
whether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding
performance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.
uu Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, planned
versus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of
variance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances
for future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, a
major delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while a
much shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require immediate action.
uu What-if scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various
scenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into
alignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.
6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD
Described in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The
variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on
near critical paths can identify schedule risk.
6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)
Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides
the ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule
baseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.

6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION
Described in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources
required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.

6.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS
Adjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind into
alignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted to
start before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical
writing team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by
eliminating or decreasing lag time.
6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPRESSION
Schedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that are
behind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.
6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS
6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work
is performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be
calculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and
(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).
6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTS
Schedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project’s future based on
information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work
performance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the project’s past performance
and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance
indicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.

6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS
Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performance
measures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule
baseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed
for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may
include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.
6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES
Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
uu Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to
reflect a change in the way the schedule is managed.
uu Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in
response to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration
estimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compression
techniques or performance issues.
uu Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates.
uu Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement
baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.
In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the
performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.

6.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES
Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
uu Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise
assumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity.
uu Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the
way duration estimates were developed.
uu Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
techniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were
used to respond to schedule variances.
uu Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model
populated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project.
uu Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes to
the utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and
corrective or preventive actions.
uu Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated
based on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques.
uu Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to
display approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, project
schedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed to
provide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.
