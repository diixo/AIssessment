1. Assistant Auditor (role, ???)

2. Assistant ProjectManager (role, LLM fine-tuned for reasoning, support the smart dialogue)

3. Assistant Developer (role, LLM fine-tuned for reasoning, support the smart dialogue)

4. Assistant Information (files indexing, smart-search on RAG)

Scope of Work:

1. Research on already existed datasets

1. Create own Dataset:
  Implement generator for synthetic data for own dataset. 
  Goals: 
  * cover maximal density and data entropy to cover multi-turns of dialogues 
  * support reasoning dialogues (follow focus of conversation)

2. research to Configure LLM:
   Goals: 
   * select optimal architecture of LLM
   * create optimal configuration (amount of layers, sizes of layers etc)
   Output is datasets of two types:
   1) Dataset for logic tracking and understanding
   2) Dataset for QAs (phormal type answers, humoristic-type answers etc...)

3. Training process:
   Create pipeline for:
   * training of dialogues (answer-question correctness) 
   * training of reasoning (tracking the logic, etc...)

4. Create web-system (UI front-end + back-end) to interract User with Model (Python+Django)
